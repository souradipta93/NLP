ortho-tri-cyclen,1,"ortho-tri-cyclen birth prevention - Although this type of birth control has more cons than pros, it did help with my cramps. It's also effective with the prevention of pregnancy. (Along with use of condoms as well) Heavy Cycle, Cramps, Hot Flashes, Fatigue, Long Lasting Cycles. It's only been 5 1/2 months, but i'm concidering changing to a different bc. This is my first time using any kind of bc, unfortunately due to the constant hassel, i'm not happy with the results. I Hate This Birth Control, I Would Not Suggest This To Anyone.",Low
ponstel,10,"ponstel menstrual cramps - I was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least 2 days.  The Ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. Definitely a miracle medication!! Heavier bleeding and clotting than normal. I took 2 pills at the onset of my menstrual cramps and then every 8-12 hours took 1 pill as needed for about 3-4 days until cramps were over. If cramps are bad, make sure to take every 8 hours on the dot because the medication stops working suddenly and unfortunately takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick back in.. if cramps are only moderate, taking every 12 hours is okay.",high
prilosec,3,"prilosec acid reflux - The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life. Constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days. I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day. Medication was taken once, every morning before eating. Each treatment duration was for 6 months.",Low
lyrica,2,"lyrica fibromyalgia - I think that the Lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue. I felt extremely drugged and dopey.  Could not drive at all while on this med.  Also had extreme ankle and feet swelling and couldn't even wear shoes. See above",Low
propecia,1,"propecia hair loss - after taking propecia for over a year, starting when i was 20 years of age my hair continued to thin, and i noticed no significant benefits Low sex drive, before i started taking this drug i was 19 years of age and full of ""enthousiasm"". Now engaged and 21 years old, my sex drive is very low, my wife and I are very unsatisfied. I am also very tired even during peak hours throughout the day, and its hard to concentrate on mundain tasks one pill once daily",Low
vyvanse,9,"vyvanse add - My mood has noticably improved, I have more energy, experience better sleep and digestion. a few experiences of nausiea, heavy moodswings on the days I do not take it, decreased appetite, and some negative affect on my short-term memory. I had began taking 20mg of Vyvanse for three months and was surprised to find that such a small dose affected my mood so effectively.  When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.",high
elavil,10,"elavil depression - Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage. None. One a day, taken about an hour before bedtime.",high
xanax,10,"xanax panic disorder - This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment. I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth. I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. And, the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!",high
claritin,1,"claritin allergies - none - did nothing to help allergies. i just had a dryer, more painful version of my allergies with new allergies/irritations developing on top of my original ones. this stuff is dangerous and the side effects that many people are experiencing are not listed on the package. a class action lawsuit needs to happen. I had some horrifying mental and physical side effects. ruined a year of my life.  read this - it mentions everything i dealt with: http://www.askapatient.com/viewrating.asp?drug=19658&name=CLARITIN took one 10 mg pill nightly.",Low
flagyl,7,"flagyl bacterial vaginosis - I experienced complete clearing of the Vaginosis after the regimin was completed. I did get a mild yeast infection during treatment. I took the antibiotic as prescribed every day, twice a day, one pill each time. My Bacterial Vaginosis cleared up after treatment. However, I did have a slight yeast infection that went away with an OTC treatment.",high
dextroamphetamine,8,"dextroamphetamine add - Smoother more gradual onset and effect than Adderall. Effective at controlling ADD symptoms previously controlled by Adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. Less tension and anxiety. Less ""druggy"" unnatural feelings and thoughts. Dexerine IR tablets need to be taken more often than adderall and also wear off more abruptly. Generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets. Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine to compare the effects. Dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while Adderall is a mixture of Amphetamine salts. This might explain the increased effectiveness of the Dexedrine contrary to popular belief. I found it important to take several relatively low doses frequently to achieve a balanced effect.",high
sarafem,8,"sarafem depression - I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles. My sides effects were not noticeable and very mild.  I have noticed some lower libido while on Fluoxetine, but no other noticeable side effects. This was prescribes to me for treatment for depression, seasonable disorder and hormonal irritability.   I have gone off this medication while pregnant, but have resumed to help ease depression issues.",high
latisse,9,"latisse sparse eyelashes - For the first time in my life I had enough lashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions which only broke off or pulled out what few thin lashes I did have.  Strip lashes were itchy and uncomfortable.  I now have normal lashes.
Even though I only applied it to upper lashes the lower lashes have grown longer and thicker too. My upper eyelids were red and itchy for the first 4-5 weeks but that went away and I have not had a problem since.  My eye exams have been normal with eye preassure normal. For the first 6-8 weeks I used one drop every night applied to upper lash base with a small disposable brush.  After my lashes had grown in I started using it every 2-3 nights instead of every night and the lashes have stayed longer and thicker than prior to treating them.",high
aldara,4,"aldara skin cancer - Aldara did seem to crust up my previous skin cancer area and help minimize my scar from MOHS surgery for skin cancer. Due to the side effects I could only tolerate for one week opposed to 6 week regiman. I felt an out of it feeling, like a depressed feeling, I was fatigued and I broke out with severe blisters on and around my lips. I used 1/4 of a packet(5% cream) on just my nose every other night and on alternating nights I put on an entire packet on my entire face.",Low
effexor-xr,8,"effexor-xr anxiety - reduction in anxiety, no panic attacks.  drug is extremely effective no side effects while on drug.  Super bad side effects while going off the drug.  Google searched it.  Lots of people with the same symptoms.  read up before you start it. took medication for 5 to 6 years.  Very hard to get off this drug.  I liked the way my anxiety was controlled, but it also inhibits all emotional response (at least in my case).  I didn't have any mood, emotion, nothing.  It gave me a very flat affect.  Also my doctor did not seem very informed toward drug side effects and withdrawl symptomologies.",high
neurontin,6,"neurontin nerve disorder - I'm taking Gabapentin to treat nerve disorder. My nerves are inflamed and causes to experience pelvic pain and other pelvic disorders. The Gabapentin sometimes works but I do experience relapse.

For the migraines
I find that the 800mg of Ibprofen works better with no side effect for my migraines, but the maxalt has a better track record. I have no side effect while taking Gabapentin but if I miss a couple of dosages or run out and wait for my next refill, I have moderate withdrawal syptoms. These syptoms include itchness, irrability, moodness, axiousness, and headaches.

Maxalt side effect for  me is throat feels contristricted shortly after taking medicine. I take 600mg of Gabapentin three times day. It seems to be effective but I feel I need a hire dosage as the longer I take it the more I experience relapses.I first started out with 300mg three times a day but it was ineffective.",high
omnicef,1,"omnicef sore throat ear infections - don't know yet back to pediatrician today My one year old daughter who has an awesome disposition (and always has) became restless and agitated. Very touchy, aggressive, crying a lot, and having a hard time sleeping. Also refluxing a lot and not nursing normally. It just dawned on me this morning it must be the medication. Will request another antibiotic today from the pediatrician. Thanks",Low
klonopin,8,"klonopin generalized anxiety disorder - Very good at relieving anxiety.  Good at generally calming me down and 'leveling me out' to make functioning easier.  Helps a little to relax muscle tension.  Calming effect makes an excellent sleep aid. Fatigue can sometimes be excessive.  High dependency. Used for general anxiety and as an adjunct for depression and chronic pain.  Very good at alleviating any anxiety and jittery feelings.  'Levels out' my mood but doesn't cause euphoria; I have no desire to take more than I need.  However I am very dependent on it; if I stop taking it for a couple of days I have bad nervousness and jitteryness, tachycardia, sweating, and other anxiety symptoms.  If I wanted to discontinue I would have to do _very_ slowly, but this is the nature of long-term benzodiazepine treatment.",high
dovonex,6,"dovonex psoriasis - Controlled the psoriasis, however did not reduce its presence. a ""halo"" a few shades lighter than the natural skin tone was present around the site of application, which would last about 12-24 hours. I found this time-consuming to apply 1-2 times daily.  Also, due to the ""halo"" effect, it was a little precarious to apply as well.",high
protopic,8,"protopic ezcema - cure the ezcema and it took aout teh roughest of the skin skin redness and flushes, sometimes the skin eels like it is on fire, and you feel very ho.
It is also very itchy when the skin is heeling because of the drug, sometimes you even wake up in the middle of the night because of the itchiness. But this only happens the first few days, when the skins is very bad with ezcema, after a few days, when the skin is better you don't feel you have put any treatment in the skin, and it feels as any othe normal moisturiser cream to apply once a day afeter cleaning the skin, and avoid direct sunlight",high
effexor,9,effexor panic attacks and depression - reduction of panic attacks and depression to almost nil nausea for first two weeks then no perceived ill effects started on a low dose (25mg) and built up to 150mg over 3 months which was reduced to 75mg per day after six months. This dose continues today. A six month treatment break resulted in a return of the symptoms so treatment was resumed at 25mg up to 75mg after one month.,high
sotret,10,"sotret acne - I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal. First, let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but I'm hoping for the best. I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.  There were no real ""details"" associated with my treatment aside from what I've alreay described.",high
retin-a-micro,8,"retin-a-micro anti-aging, acne - The treatment benefits included Skin Regeneration, and decreased Acne.  My skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  Overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over. The side effects of the treatment included Redness, Dryness, Skin Irritation.  The skin was very dry and difficult to moisturize.  The skin looked red and irritated.   However, when I switched to a lighter skin cleanser, Cetaphil, this really helped improve the redness and dryness.  Prior to the Cetaphil i was using Roc cleansing pads which were too harsh on my skin. My routine included Daily use of Micro Retin A pump.  I applied the Retin A Micro pump to my entire face at night after washing my face.  I used a moisturizer and sun screen in the morning.",high

symbicort,10,"symbicort asthma, emphysema - I had taken Pulmicort, and other inhalants, with no major changes.  It became more difficult to maintain my exercise and lively life style. I gave in and began Symbicort and immediately experienced a relief of shortness of breath, weezing.  I feel like a new person. I still have a reaction to cold wind, and very high humidity, but so much better.  I rarely use my Albuterol. none I take one puff in the am, rinse my mouth and gargle.  I repeat the treatment in the evening before bed.",high
lamictal,8,"lamictal bipolar disorder and depression - I'm feeling more grounded; highs and lows are less extreme.  You could say that my emotional 'playing field' is more level. There's one 'side effect' - and I'm purposely and playfully/sarcastically placing it within quotes:  this stuff has increased my sex-drive manyfold! I don't know if this has been the case with other patients, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has had that experience.
I'm also presenting with a little 'feathery tickle', resulting in an annoying dry cough; perhaps this side effect will lessen as my body adapts to the medication. My doctor started me on a minimal dose (25 mg) of Lamotrigine, and this will be prior to starting Interferon/Ribavarin treatment for the Hep-C I've got.  (An antidepressant may be added in the near future as well.) Lamotrigine was prescribed to put me in a calmer state of mind, specifically because of the high anxiety effect I receive from antidepressants, which resulted in 2 visits to an emergency room - as well as a one month hospital stay due to extreme anxiety and paranoia.
So far/so good is this layman's analysis.",high
lyrica,1,"lyrica fibromyalgia, failed back syndrome - It seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. Fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). The hard part is I can't seem to get off this stuff!! The withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. It scares me so much that I just start taking it again. I'm stuck!! Don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. I don't know if I will ever be myself again. see above Lyrica 150mg twice a day",Low

vyvanse,8,"vyvanse adhd - Alert, awake, focused dry mouth, decreased appetite I have only been on Vyvanse for 2 weeks.  I started at 40 mg. and now at 60 mg. until next week where I will probably be upped to 70 mg.  I used to take Focalin and then found out I was bipolar so had to stop that for close to a year to become stable on lithium.  I feel alert, awake and focused and feel Vyvanse is very smooth and lasts longer.  Hope I get the weight loss benefits eventually.",high
actonel,7,"actonel osteoporosis - My  bone density's results have always been stable and I was told to continue with the drug. leg cramps during the night. Eight years ago I started with Fosamax for 3-4 years and then took Actonel.
In March, I decided not to take Actonel any longer.   I had been on it for too long and was fearful of esophageal cancer and bone breakage.  Now my doctor wants me to take the Prolia injections, which I am not going to do. I am not going to continue with any drugs.   My bone density recently done was in the minuses.  I do work with a personal trainer and execise daily.  I am searching for alternative ways to deal with this problem.",high
provigil,7,"provigil fatigue - I was more alert during the first part of the day but I found that it wore off by the afternoon. I could focus clearly, and if I needed a boost during the day another dose was enough. It may cause some nervousness or restlessness. Sometimes I felt like I had drank a large cup of coffee during its full potency. I took modafinil for cronic fatigue and general drousiness. I found it to be moderatly effective. 

In the morning after I would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced, however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and I would have to take another dose, but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time.",high
ambien,8,ambien insomnia - Sleeping 7-8 hours without hangover Memory loss It is a GODSEND. Fully rested in the am and feel like a new person. I am convinced it has kept me from sliding into a full depression. It works on 3 levels for me: 1. My body gets rest so I can 'fight' for another day. 2. My brain heals. 3. I can endure a difficult day knowing I can take the pill and go to sleep. I consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression. Wish I had it available to me years ago...could have changed my life. I would recommend to anyone in for a good experience while getting to sleep!,high
wellbutrin,10,"wellbutrin depression - I have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not ""flip the switch"" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before. A little bit of ""hyper"" feelings.  I take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning. I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months, and 2) they completely destroyed my libido.",high
propecia,8,"propecia male pattern baldness - Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose. I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. This pressure would subside and I would go about my day. I'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. However, I've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. The sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but I would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around. Overall, whether I am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. I presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which I filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. My case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. However, other than the mild side-effects I described above, which subsided within three days, I must say overall that my experience has been a positive one.",high
nortriptyline,3,"nortriptyline a typical migraines - I have A-typical migraines which gives me weird sensation in my ears such as roaring and the sense that they are vibrating.  I also do have headacheds that seem to come from ears and the back of my neck.  It help me feel better and started to decrease my symptoms but side effects were worse than original symptoms.  It helped me to ignore my symptoms and helped me to get through the day. ringing in the ears, sensitivity to noise, phantom noise in head, which all lead to anxiety stopped medicine, looking for something else to help.",Low
imitrex,10,"imitrex migraine headaches - migraine headache would stop dizzy, palpitations I have taken both the shots and the pills (separately) and they both worked well.  I would need to take the pills before getting sick to stomach, because if after, I could not keep pills down.  The shot worked regardless of when I took it.",high
ativan,9,"ativan anxiety - Assists with getting to sleep and due to longer half life than other anxiolytics(ie Alprazolam)anxiety is less upon waking. Whilst Alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal, I find Lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.It has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication. As with all Benzodiazepines withdrawl is very noticeable if undertaken quickly. Lightheadedness, anxiety, dizzy spells, general feeling unwell.
In my experience the suggested half life in relation to reducing intake of these drugs is very misleading. Reduction for me has to be done very slowly over a number of weeks not days as usually suggested by physicians. Taken for anxiety,initially in an acute stage. This was followed by a decision by patient (myself) to continue for 3 months in order to reduce arousal levels whilst undertaking therapy using the theraputic model ACT.",high
doxycycline,10,"doxycycline severe peridontal disease - I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish. None. A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.",high
prozac,7,"prozac depression - relieves depression, helps other things such as sleep, dieting, exercise, relationships, responses to stimulous.  The cost is lower than other antidepressants which can be a help to those on a budget. Sleepy and lack of response to problems.  Took too long to get started.  I think anyone else would think it wasn't effective and stop taking it. took a seemingly long period of time to become effective.  Once started, however, it did what I expected.  It is hard to be without now and think that it will be a problem stopping in the future.",high

oxycodone,7,"oxycodone possible lymphoma/kidney pain - The drug was pretty good for pain. They had me on morphine, which was horrible. The pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia I had. They then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects. Sleepiness, dizziness, light-headedness & nausea. I only took them when the pain was unbearable, so I might have gotten used to the side effects if I had kept the levels up in my system. I just took the pills every 4-6 hours when the kidney pain was too bad. I tried to only take them at night as the conditions improved since they made me sleep. I stopped takeing them long before the infections and colon problems were resolved, as I don't like takeing drugs.",high
lamictal,8,"lamictal seizure disorder - Effective at controlling seizures without dizziness There were no side effects I took Dilantin for decades.  My doctor moved me to Trileptal; it was not 100% effective and caused dizziness, plus it was very expensive.  Lamictal controls my seizures, although I still get headaches (auras).  I would like to be completely free of these headaches, but this is still better than previous medications.",high

accutane,9,"accutane acne - Eventually Cleared my moderate acne. Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months Hair loss! Not so much from my head, but other places such as arms etc. Dry lips were the worst, tried many different products but eventually carmex solved that. Dry skin slightly, not too much of a probelem. Depression was bad, would have no motivation to do anything and hated everything around me. After stopping the drug this discontinued and i deem it acceptable to have, for the results of clear skin. I can't remember ever having the initial flare ups/breakouts other people have reported. I was warned about this by my dermatologist but i can't say i remember it. I noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. It was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. By the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.",high

aldara,10,"aldara basal cell carcinoma - The cream made the basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses react, scab up, and heal to nice smooth skin after about two weeks after treatment with the cream ended. I had no side effects.  Some people think the ulcerated scabby areas are side effects, but this is what the cream is designed to do, make bad cells react and destruct. The cream is applied at bedtime for five nights a week for Basal Cell Carcinoma.  Three night per week for actinic keratosis.  You do this for eight weeks in a row.  By the end of eight weeks, the bad cells react gradually as scabby spots.  This is how you know the medicine is working.

The treatment had no side effect on me. I don't have severe acne problem, just occasional break out.  I was prescribed Minocycline by my doctor and was advised to take it once a day for treatment of my acne.  I was told that it would take up to six month to see result.  After more than a year being on it, it did very little for me.  I was still breaking out, it just that some of my break out was not as bad.

meridia,10,"meridia over weight - Lost over 30 pounds and still going! The first week I had a very dry mouth all the time. So I started taking 15mg Meridia once daily and lost 20 pounds in the first month. I was so excited, I never expected this pill to work at all.
But Then the following week I gained 8 pounds, so I stopped taking it. Its been 2 months now since I have taken one and I've lost an additional 19 pounds since I have stopped. 
I notice that I will usually gain a pound or two and the following week loose 4 or 5. Sometimes I'll have 2 weeks of no weight lose followed by a week of pretty dramatic weight lose.

tekturna,10,"tekturna hypertension - Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks. I had a very slight issue, early on in treatment (in the first few weeks only), of slight dizziness when rising quickly from either laying down or from bending over with my head down (such as when petting my cat when she was laying on the floor), but that fully resolved quite quickly. I have not had any other side effects at all. I take one 300mg Tekturna per day, in the morning, along with 10mg of Terazosin (Hytrin) and my blood pressure is wonderfully under control.

My triglyceride levels were reduced as well. One side effect my doctor warned me to watch for was loss of muscle density.  I work out with weights usually three times a week.  I noticed no loss of muscle size, tone, or strength while taking Crestor. Because my LDL cholesterol was in the ""high risk"" range by American Heart Assn. standards, it was important to lower my risk level quickly.  In addition to taking 5 mg. of Crestor daily, I made disciplined adjustments to my diet.  I cut out animal fats, including dairy fats (like cheese and ice cream).  I cut out trans fats (like partially hydrogenated oils).  I greatly increased my consumption of wheat bran and oat bran, and raw vegetables.  I also took 500 mg. of time-release Niacin with my lunch each day.  Once I got my LDL cholesterol down to below 100 mg/dL, my doctor revised my prescription to only 2.5 mg. Crestor per day.  Since Crestor is not sold in this dosage, I must cut the pills in half.  I was tested again after 60 days at this dosage, and my LDL was still below 100 mg/dL.

I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times. In the first week of treatment I felt disconnected from myself. I felt fuzzy and had trouble thinking clearly. It was this side effect that made me not want to take the drug anymore but I continued taking it 2 times per day. By the second week the fuzziness began to lift and I felt more like my normal self.

The doctor mentioned it would make birth control ineffective but had no confirmation of that. Face and body cleared up conciderably.  It did take a while for the drug to take effect - but was worth it in the end.  I am now pregnant and will continue treatments after I have the baby.

I am not allowed to lay down, as that will cause the sickness.  I also have to wait at least 1/2 hour before taking a drink of juice, coffee, tea, etc. This drug can also cause heartburn. There is really not much to describe.  I now take the drug once a week instead of once everyday and am very happy with taking it this way.

The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle. At first I seemed a bit hot. I sweat more often. Then I began not being able to handle any stress at all. I began feeling like I needed other aids to help me deal with everyday stress and I have never needed anything before. Then my stomach began to act up. I began having constipation or diarrhea constantly. Never normal. I began throwing up and now my stomach does not digest food well at all. I also was unable to sleep, severe insomnia. I chose to take myself off the medication because the stomach issues have completely taken over my life and causing major disability.

ambien-cr,8,"ambien-cr insomnia - I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours. I sometimes feel groggy the morning after. The one time I took it nightly for 3 weeks, I had been under a great deal of stress, and then jet lag (I travelled to Europe). In addition to the grogginess, I also just didn't feel good.Very hard to describe, but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. For occasional use, it is better than the alternative, though I'm not sure I believe the time-release is worth the cost. Next time I'll try the generic. The treatment details? I like to have it on hand, but not to use unless I can't get to sleep any other way. Often, I go to sleep easily enough, but wake in the middle of the night. If it's 2-3am, I will take one, and might be groggy in the morning, but I function better than if I couldn't go back to sleep.

imitrex,10,"imitrex migraine headaches - I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person. I have never had any negative side effects from Imitrex. I take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting.  Usually within 45-60 minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone.  Once in awhile, at this point (60 minutes after I have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different, so I will take another half of a tablet.",high

I try to stay physically active and eat healthy foods.",high
lexapro,5,"lexapro depression and generalized anxiety - I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced. I gained 15 pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  BUT - I have always struggled to GAIN weight - I weighed 95 pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy 115 with a lot of hard work.  In just the two months of being on Lexapro, I went up to 130.  Not being able to fit into any of my clothes during summer is NOT helping my depression.

Immediately upon beginning to take Lexapro, I felt ""high"" for about two weeks.  My doctor says ""that shouldn't happen because of the medication.""  Well, I wasn't doing any other drugs, so I don't know what to tell you there.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Also, I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm. I missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so I have been off the Lexapro for a week.  In that time, I no longer needed to take naps and although I still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-Lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels I experienced while on the drug.  My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.  (Again, my doctor said ""This medication shouldn't do that. Maybe you have the flu."")  Last night, though, I had great sex with my husband and was able to orgasm easily.

latisse,10,"latisse sparse eyelashes - For the first time in my life, I had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes I did have.  After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too. My eyelids became red and itchy for the first month of use.  It was bothersome but not enough that I quit using the product.  After about 4-6 weeks the redness went away and I have not been bothered by it again. I applied a single drop of Latisse to a brush and ran it along the base of my upper lashes each night for the first 2 months and now just use it about every 2-3 days and my lashes have stayed longer and thicker even with less use.",high
wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl depression - The Wellbutrin with 20 mg of Prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  Better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day. Jitters, trembling hands. I had been taking Prozac with other medications for 10 years and it had stopped working for me.  After being prescribed Wellbutrin with it, I found I felt so much better.  However, when I tried to stop taking Prozac entirely and stay just on the Wellbutrin, my depression returned.  I have been on this cocktail now for 5 years and believe it has helped me immensly.",high

The side effects associated with the use of Tazorac daily for the treatment of antiaging skin is severe dry skin, erythema or skin redness and severe flaking and burning of the skin. There was quite abit of tingling even after the gel had dried overnight. The treatment details for the skin gel Tazorac was to apply it once a day, or in my case nightly to the face. Not more than a small pea size of cream was directed however this was quickly absorbed into the skin and could not be applied over the remainging area of the face. Caution was applied in ensuring that the treatment gel was not applied to mucosal areas. Nevertheless it did radiate to areas such as the eyes and lips causing severe dryness and chafing.",high

valtrex,9,"valtrex cold sore/fever blister (herpes-simplex) - I took this medication, Valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which I had experienced many times before - usually once a year.
The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak. No negative side effects were experienced. Take two tablets by mouth with water twice daily for one day.",high
femring,10,"femring menopause - Do not experience hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings or insomnia due to menopause when using the Femring. Use of Provera once monthly for 14 days caused excessive menstrual bleeding for 3 weeks at a time.  Also experienced a localized skin irritation. Femring is inserted vaginally and replaced every 3 months.  Hormones are released in daily doses.  Provera was taken once monthly to slough uterus lining by forcing menstruation.",high

I was just proscribed this medication yesterday took first one before bed as doctor said and woke up this morning feeling like i had drank a case of beer i stumbled getting up out of bed then i felt like i was dying of thirst was just wondering how normal this was?

soma,5,soma back injury - Minimized pain immediatley and made back injury seem non-existant Could not remember doing things.  ALmost like being in a time warp.  Not good to take this medication unsupervised. Have a bulging disc.  I was given Carisoprodol to relieve the pain.  I took the medication for 2 weeks.  I actually needed it much longer but the side effects were too intense.  This medication does relieve pain but in no way cures injury.,high
lipitor,5,"lipitor high cholesterol - My overall cholesterol reduced to just over 4, but not LDL which still remained high within that total. This in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition. After several months with no side effects I suddenly had continuous bad muscular neck pain and stiffness (particularly at night) which got better when I stopped the statin. My cardiologist orginally prescribed atorvastatin and Omacor (at my asking about Omega 3 efficacy) due to my having a completed blocked artery in my heart (discovered on an ebt scan by my thyroid doc). I have since tried other statins but have not stayed on any of them very long due to lack of results in bringing down my LDL and side effects such as stomach pain.",high
tylenol,3,"tylenol pain - Little if any relief from headache. Patient experienced severe nausea accompanied by moderate lower right abdominal pain. Patient experienced severe headache accompanied by sensitivity to light.  Packing information claimed relief of headache as a suggested usage.  Patient purchased in reliance on packaging information.  After administration of the prescribed dosage over a period of twelve hours, little or no relief was noticed.",Low
ultram,2,"ultram ovarian cysts/sciatic nerve - I found for me it was great for pain relief. Also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past, I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally. In the beginning I had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. After about 2 months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. I also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch, but only for a second and only once in a while.  Therefore, I decided that I would discontinue taking the medication.  That is when my problems began. I was told by my doctor and pharmacist that this was a non-addictive medication, but when I quit taking it the withdrawal symptoms were extreme.  I had cold chills,severe body aches, diarrhea, nausea, headache, heart palpitations, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, vomiting and depressed feelings. I got a refill prescription to gradually come off of it after that and it occurred once again.  I have never had substance abuse issues but after doing some research learned that it is opiate-based and highly addictive. I have never felt that kind of pain and sickness in my life and pray I never do again. I have heard similar experiences from others as well. I would not recommend this drug and do not believe that it is not addictive.  From now on, I will do my homework before I take anything else. I now use OTC pain relievers and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same before beginning treatment with tramadol or any pain reliever.",Low
chantix,5,"chantix stop smoking aid - Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned. The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day. Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  This, however, may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months.",high
ziana,9,"ziana acne - Easy to apply, combination of retinol and antibiotic.  Treated acne and an anti-aging treatment too.  The gel is odorless and goes on easily.  It is also non-greasy which is important if you have combination or oily skin. Dry, peeling skin.  Skin was more sensitive for a short time.  Also need to wear a high SPF daily for skin protection. Apply once a day at night on dry skin.",high
vivelle-dot,5,vivelle-dot surgical menopause - The benefits are that it does take away night sweats and hot flashes. The side effect I have noticed is very sore swollen breasts and weight gain! Not sure if I want to stay on the Vivelle Dot for those reasons. The weight gain is making me very unhappy. Change the patch twice a week.,high
effexor-xr,7,"effexor-xr anxiety/ ocpd /depression - After trying Celexa for several months this drug finally made a difference with my anxiety and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I noticed considerable change after using for 3-4 weeks. I am much more tolerant of things being ""out of control"" and have stopped some of my ""patterns"". I have occasional night sweats, very vivid dreams and almost no sexual desire. I had taken this drug several years ago for depression. I weaned myself off gradually after using for about 1 and 1/2 years. I have been in counceling for the past 5 months and was diagnosed with OCPD. The constant perfectionism created so much anxiety for me. I felt ""stuck"". After trying Celexa for several months I thought I would give the Effexor another try. I am very glad I did. The only down side is the cost. The drug is very expensive.",high
ultram-er,1,"ultram-er pain relief  from an infected cat bite wound - I was not able to ascertain any benefits from being treated with this medication.  Its purpose was pain relief, and I did not experience any alleviation of my pain. I did not experience any side effects from taking this medication. I was prescribed this medication after being seen by a doctor for a severely infected cat bite wound on the top of my left foot (which the doctor was concerned might become a systemic infection).  The foot and my entire left leg were very painful (especially upon movement), so the doctor had me take Ultram ER to help relieve the pain.  I was told to take 1 tablet daily as needed.  I did as instructed for two consecutive days and did not have any relief from my pain.  After I reported this to my doctor, she gave me a prescription for a stronger pain reliever (which did help).",Low
lotrel,7,"lotrel high blood pressure - I have slightly high blood pressure on the diastolic side. Lotrel did a good job at maintaining good levels without increasing my pulse which I experienced with other BP meds. After introducing Lotrel within two weeks I notices small red dots appear on my ankles which I thought was just a heat rash. I developed Petechiae which is the bleeding of small capillaries in the skin or mucous membrane. It appears as round pinpoint sized dots that vary in colour from red to blue or purple. These dots most commonly appear on the legs but can appear all over the body. Also an onset on Acne developed on my back at about the same time which was quite severe, and I have never had Acne related problems, even in my youth. Currently my physician has taken me off of my BP meds to allow the Petechiae to fade, and to ensure that the reaction was indeed related to the Lotrel. It has been 4 days and slowly the rash and redness is mellowing.",high
viagra,4,viagra erectile disfunction - Viagra did help me in acheiving an erection after prostrate surgery. Other methods that were offered were not as attractive at the 3 times daily dosage of Viagra. Dizzyiness and flushing of the skin. The side effects became worse the longer I used this drug. I became too dizzy to be able to drive and preform my job. I was given Viagra to correct ED after a racial prostate surgery. The side effects vs. the benfits of Viagra were not worth it.,Low
seasonale,9,"seasonale birth control - While taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. It was much lighter than before and only lasted 3 days instead of 6, which was normal before. I didn't experience any bloating. It's a very cost-effective method compared to three-month supply of normal 28 day cycle pills. I noticed a slight weight gain (about 2 pounds) and still had issues with breakouts on my face prior to starting my period. There was also breakthrough bleeding, although very slight, at the times when my period would normally hit. It's very easy to take one pill per day and only have one ""off"" week in three months.",high

Took paxil and lexapro in past, gave me suicidal thoughts and actions when drinking alcohol with them.  Decided ssri's are not for me. keep hoping wellbutrin will help soon.",high
lipitor,1,"lipitor cholesterol slightly elevated - I didn't take the product long enough to evaluate the benefits. I quit because of side effects. Very painful muscles, it took a while to even get them going in the morning. When my cholesterol was found to be slightly elevated, my cardiologist put me on Lipitor. The first week was fine. The beginning of the second week I began to have sore muscles all over. By the end of the second week this was so bad I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. So I quit the Lipitor (did not consult the doctor on this); in the AARP magazine (or else newsletter, not sure which) there was a question for the medical doctor about possible natural replacements for the statin medications and he recommended Red Yeast Rice. I found a product with that and a few other cholesterol-lowering supplements (primarily CoQ-10) ad have been taking that with no side effects. I am due for another blood test in a couple of weeks, so we will see how well it has been working.",Low

I only take it as needed - not",high
ambien-cr,7,"ambien-cr insomnia - The benefits from the ambien CR were phenominal when trying to fall asleep. It worked very well.

accutane,8,"accutane acne - Finally clear skin and less oil!  Prior to accutane I HAD to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now I easily an go a day or two.   My face and back were perfectly clear. I would have spent my last $2 on lip balm, even if I hadn't eaten in a week!  Talk about dry and flaking!   Don't even THINK about waxing.  I didn't know that you couldn't wax (it was 12 years ago and there was less information about it then) it ripped my skin right off!  Scary.  About 4 ear after my first round I did another go with accutane because my acne had returned and now, 12 years later my skin is one again pretty bad.  Unfortunately not bad enough for accutane.  I mus say however, I have never been as bad as I was before my initial treatment and my back has stayed perfectly clear since then. You have to really want it to get it!  For females it is a pain because you have to do two initial pregnancy tests and then continue ever month to get a refill.  They also monitor your blood for possible liver toxicity and your hdl levels.  It is one pill 2x daily.",high
nasonex,10,"nasonex congestion - Able to breath at night, less sneezing. I woke up with less nasal stufiness and felt clear headed. I also appreciated the moisturizing glycerin in Nasonex. I have a extremely dry nasal mucosa so there was definitely a benefit to that. Did not have any side effects  and I felt extremely good during the allergy season. I actually enjoyed the moisterizing glycerin in my nose. Use in the morning and evening in the spring allergy season. Continue to use even if symptoms disapear and 2 to 4 weeks prior to full blown allergy symptoms.",high
fortaz,8,"fortaz uti - got rid of the uti, however, it took longer than d-mannose a non-prescription otc natural sugar which also had no side-effects vaginal yeast infection which required treatment This drug got rid of the infection, however, since that time I have discovered d-mannose from the health food store it works faster and does not have any side effects, is cheaper, no doctor visit required",high
singulair,1,"singulair asthma - There were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath. Shortness of breath, weakness. Singulair was intended to address my Asthma and constant coughing due to allergic asthma; instead Singulair made my symptoms much worse.  Singulair significantly increased shortness of breath and fatigue--even during inactivity.  Due to the worsening of symptoms, I only took Singulair for two days.  Unfortunately, it took a few months before I was able to get back to my baseline (where I was prior to taking the drug).",Low
xyrem,9,"xyrem insomnia - While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds. Some nights I felt significant joint pain, primarily in my elbows and my shoulders.  Other nights I suffered night sweats so severe that I would have to change out of my wet pajamas.  On occasion when falling asleep I would feel very giddy, almost ""high."" Lack of sleep severely impacts my mood and none of the other sedative medications that I had tried worked, so I tried xyrem with beneficial effects.",high
provigil,7,"provigil fatigue not being able to get up in am - When I started first taking it it was great. I would get up in the am no brain fog, and could work the whole day not being tired. By night time though I was exhausted. After a month or so I still get up early but by afternoon I am so tired I usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. I have not tried taking another in the afternoon. I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference. I am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but I have started having major breathing issues. I have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. Now I am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. I wonder if it is being caused from the provigil. I just take one 200mg every morning when I get up. If I do not take it I thought is why I would be so sleepy during the day. But now I get sleepy anyway. But the waking up early is great were as I could not get up before.",high
xanax,10,"xanax tia's - anxiety - The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode. I have had no side effects from the use of this medicine. When I first started the medication it would make me sleepy. After time this side effect past and I have no problems now. Upon treatment I found that results were immediate. I have been told that this drug is highly addictive, however that does not concern me as my Neurologist will keep me on this medicine for the remainder of my life.",high
lexapro,9,"lexapro major depression/anxiety - Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had ""bouts"" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life. I have some difficulty sleeping (waking up in the night). Sometimes I have diarrhea, but not enough so it stops me from taking it. I have not had any weight gain, but do feel bloated sometimes. Once in awhile I get a weird high feeling which passes very quickly. I have found  that I have to take it at night because of the sedating effect it seems to have on me, but that is not a problem. I was on 10 mg, and ramped up to 20 mg fairly quickly, which was like a shock to my body.. that 3 or 4 days were like a haze, but I stuck with it and it passed. I am on it for almost 4 months now and I am feeling much more like myself.",high
vicodin,7,"vicodin periodontal surgery - There was a significant reduction in mouth pain. I was able to relax following periodontal surgey and not worry about family obligations and responsibilities.

I was presribed to take the Vicoden PRN for pain every 4-6 hours.",high
zoloft,6,"zoloft depression - Moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so I could function better in everyday life. None that I could detect. Nothing noticeable. Maybe just a bit more insomnia but I had that before taking Zoloft. I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years, awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering,but noticeable.",high
differin,9,"differin acne - The patient saw effective acne control within 4 weeks.  She still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  Because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  At four weeks, her skin tone was even. Dryness at the corners of the mouth was the major problem. I find if you apply moisturizer or a small amount of vaseline to the area prior to apply the Differin, the irritation will resolve quickly. Medication is easy to use, and high patient satisfaction.",high
zyban,9,"zyban smoking - I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug. There was a feeling of complete disassociation from reality, people, feelings. I felt as if i was depressed. However at the same time I experienced times of being unable to control any emotions, my mood swings were extreme and I was completly unable to stop some fairly manic expressions of emotions. This could have been the nicotine withdrawal, but continued for a two - three month period. I stopped the drug about three weeks before prescribed as I became tired of the inability to feel happy / pleased / content. I experienced mild episodes of anxiety, vertigo and breathlessness - as I was aware these were side effects they did not overly concern me. I took one 150 mg tablet for seven days, stopped smoking on the sixth day. As prescribed I took one tablet twice a day for six weeks. After consulting the doctor over my cncerns of the side efeects I took one 150 mg tablet a day for the next four weeks.",high
anafranil,4,"anafranil ocd - Over time, this drug caused a massive reduction in my OCD hand washing rituals. I also no longer had to avoid public places for fear of germs.  Furthermore, clomipramine caused an immediate decrease in day to day anxiety and worry. Inability to reach orgasm or ejaculate. Dry mouth. I suffered severe depression and OCD.  Clomipramine was not the first drug tried, but it was the only SSRI to work for me. However, any benefits to SSRI drugs are countered by the havoc they play on your sex life.",Low

motrin,8,"motrin menstrual cramping - The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all. Side effects are I occasionally experience heartburn and nausea after taking the medication if I do not take it with food. Also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe, it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective, no matter how much i take. Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. However, the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait, the less effective the medication is, regardless the dose of the medication.",high
effexor,8,"effexor generalized anxiety disorder - I would say that in general, I feel more happy since im taking Effexor. I am more patient and less agressive.

Medication did not completely eliminate feelings of anxiety, but did a great job of reducing them.

flomax,8,"flomax kidney pain, difficult urination - As near as we can tell, this drug (which is intended for men with enlarged prostates) relaxed ureter muscles, relieving the sensation of kidney stone pain, and also relaxed bladder muscles that had caused painful urination. It made me drowsy all week; also sporadic dizziness.  Chronic nasal congestion (stuffy nose) was also unpleasant. Once kidney stones were ruled out as the cause, the choices were to ""wait it out,"" or to try this medication.

celebrex,8,celebrex arthritis - I started out with 100 mg twice a day and after about 3 years I've had to increase dosage to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime. It seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but I have never been able to just take it once a day but I've also had arthritus for 35+ years. Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do. I haven't really had any noticeable side effects. See above. I am concerned thaqt the dosage might have to be upped after a few more years.,high
accutane,10,"accutane severe acne - My skin cleared up and my pores shrank significantly. My skin looked flawless. My pores have remained smaller long-term (5+ years post treatment). My skin got very dry, including my lips. I had to use a significantly heaver moisturizer and lip ointment to keep my skin/lips from cracking. I had monthly lab work and doctor's visits to make sure I was having no ill effects, which I did not. I suffered no psychological symptoms or depression, in fact I felt less depressed because my skin looked so much better.

I would encourage patients and doctors not to be so frightened of this drug. It's a serious drug and bears monitoring, but lots of drugs are. I tried Retin-A and that made my skin look and feel horrible, as did other topical treatments. The benefits to your skin and your self-esteem make Accutane worth consideration if other treatments have not been effective.",high
zoloft,9,zoloft depression - relaxed tired Taking zoloft once a day IF YOU ARE REALLY DEPRESSED may work wonders. But try to gat off of it as soon as possible. Long term side effects are still not known.,high
prevacid,7,"prevacid acid reflux - I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids. Taken daily, Prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like I was over medicated. The side effects were so severe that I often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap. Prior to taking Prevacid, my symptoms required daily doses of anti-gas medications and occasional antacids. Although Prevacid was very effective, I discontinued use of it and switched to over the conter Zantac because of the side effects. As a note, I am very sensitive to medications and often experience side effects from different medications and thus refrain from any unless experiencing severe symptoms.",high
actiq,1,"actiq chronic pain - Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
The flavor is also quite pleasant. Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months. Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.  
Believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and I am able to care for my husband and children, and work!  After my experience with Actiq I no longer believe in the use of pharmaceutical products as a whole, and owe my good health to diet, exercise and several natural supplements.  I have never felt better in my life!",Low

Seriously, I could not even tell I had taken a drug, there were no impacts whatsover, either positive or negative. Took 2 tablets (15 mg) total, once daily in the morning.  Also took Zanaflex, but only at night.  The Zanaflex helped - for about 3 hours.  When I was just on the meloxicam, I was in terrible pain.  The injury being treated was mid-back pain, caused by straining/overusing my back muscles in a ski competition.  I have a 30 day prescription for meloxicam, but I'm calling the doctor tomorrow to ask for something different; this drug is totally pointless for me.",Low

As free time is scarce in residency, I am now able to study when I would otherwise be too exhausted to do anything. I really did not have any side effects.  It has been reported that headache is common, however I did not experience that at all.  I did not have any problems with my sleep schedule either.

-Cleared skin for (moderate) acne For the first month, there was slight depression/moodiness, but that may have been due to the fact my body was adjusting to being on birth control I've been on Ortho TRI-Cyclen for a year now, and have had little to no problems with it. Before going on the pill, I would have awfully irregular periods, and very bad cramps the first day of my cycle. Since going on it, my periods have become light, and regular. My breast have gotten larger, and my skin has cleared up. This pill is great! This being said, my results may have been so wonderful because I make ABSOLUTELY sure that I take it EVERYDAY at the SAME TIME.

zestoretic,10,"zestoretic high blood pressure - After trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed Zestoretic.  Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt None I take two tablets once a day at breakfast.",high

synthroid,10,"synthroid low under active thyroid - I became more active and lost 10 of the 14 pounds I had gained.  I have more energy, and feel like myself again. I never had any side effects.  The only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  However, they prefer you take it in the morning.  So what I do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time I wake up in the morning whether it's 4, 5, or 6 am. I returned from vacation in August by November I had gained 14 pounds.  I did not know why.  I was eating the same amount of food.  I went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found I had a low under active thyroid.  As I think back, I did feel more tired, I did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead I would go to bed early.  That is not like me.  I am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  I thought I was just tired.  Now, I reflect and remember that I stopped doing things with my family, became less active and all along I thought it was because I was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off.",high
zofran,9,"zofran nausea/vomiting - Completely controlled nausea and vomiting. Some sleepiness I was dealing with unrelenting nausea and vomiting for about five months.  A combination of other drugs was tried, and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. I had lost a lot of weight, and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. When Zofran was added to the list of drugs I was given, I had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  I now take Zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   I recently had a biopsy where I had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  The prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting, and my friend reminded the nurse that I usually used Zofran for that.  Within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and I was able to get much needed rest.",high
elavil,8,"elavil fibromyalgia - I was only sleeping around 5 hrs per night. I felt sleepy ALL the time. I had episodes when my whole body would ache, every joint and muscle. It felt like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing it until my eyes would pop out I started craving carbs. I gained weight but I didn't care because I was feeling REALLY good. As the years went by, I had to keep increasing and was up to 100mg. I had VERY dry mouth, I got to where I couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. I had to have a bottle of water next to me ALL the time, and I chewed gum constantly. I had to take laxatives every 3 days. I was so sick of it, I went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. She thought it might be the amitriptyline, so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me 30mg of Cymbalta to start. I went down to 50mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. Not sure how the Cymbalta is going to work since I've only taken it 4 days now, but I'm hoping it works. I started with 10mg.  I noticed a difference after just one week. It worked really GREAT. I was able to sleep with no problems at all. If I woke up for any reason, I'd just fall back to sleep right away.  It was a lifesaver to me. I wish I could still take it.",high
tazorac,8,"tazorac hyperpigmentation, photoaging, mild hormonal acne - marked reduction in hyperpigmented (age) spots, marked reduction in wrinkles around mouth and eyes, skin surface became much smoother and softer.  Truly turned back time.  Visible results within weeks and first 2 months were remarkable, but over the last year, the benefits have continued and areas of brown discoloration I thought would need laser therapy are almost cleared up!  I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone! dryness, redness, irritation and peeling - it took a gradual working up to the 1% dosage without having serious redness/itching-pain/dryness/sensitivity.  I had already been on retin-A so my skin was already acclimated somewhat and yet I still had side effects.  I discovered that it's most important to wait at least 40-60 min. after washing your face before applying and apply only the very least amt necessary to have the thinnest of layers (more than that and you just get peeling).  And imperative NOT to use soap - change to a cleanser - cetaphil or other.  also,  an hour or two after applying, add a strong moisturizer.  With time, i needed a stronger daytime moisturizer too.  Redness/itching/burning/ decreased significantly within 2-3 months but skin remains highly sensitive and prone to dryness.  Sunscreen is a must and it was hard to find one that did not make my skin sting though most of the time, that stinging didn't last long (5-10 mins).  Overall though, with patience and time and not pushing and rushing things..it was well worth it

pilocarpine,3,"pilocarpine high intraocular pressure (glaucoma) - The drug caused the iris to contract so that the drains that relieve fluid buildup causing high pressure are pulled open.  While using the drug the pressure in my eyes remained stable but high.  It had the added benefit of sharpening my vision for a long time so that I did not need to wear glasses for reading phonebooks,etc. The iris atrophied.  It is now impossible for my pupil to open to adjust to changing light conditions.  The iris aslo scarred to the lense making a followup cataract removal operation complicated.  The drug sped up the formation of cataracts. The drug in drop form was put in each eye three times a day.  It was a nuisance to have to carry it with me for mid day application.  The chemicals in the drops sting and leave your eyes watering for a minute or so.  Otherwise it was easy to use, although the proper technique for putting in the drops without touching the eyeball takes a little practice and a steady hand",Low

My nasal passages would constrict & I could not breathe through my  nose.  As a result, my sinuses would clog up & I would experience severe sinus headaches.  Taking this medication only as needed -- when I began to first experience the severe symptoms -- has actually seemed to decrease my symptoms overall.

There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes. It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall. I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.",high

paxil,6,"paxil depression - A more positive outlook and much easier social interaction.  Introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes. A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement. Just the one pill each morning.  This medication is such a double-edged sword that I could not recommend it.  The long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great, as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.

From that time on, my neck just itched . . . and itched . . . and itched.  After about two weeks, though, my skin acclimated fully.

abilify,2,"abilify depression not resolved with antidepressant drugs - While on abilify I can honestly say the depression resolved, but it caused memory loss and again an incident involving retail theft. The retail theft occured while on just 5 mg of abilify. It effected my judgement/reasoning skills because I did not tell my doctor & allowed him to continue to increase dosage up to 15mg when I became expremely restless. Could not set down, paced for hours & called my doctor about this. Also during the 2 months I was taking this drug I charged a little over 15,000 on my credit cards that had no balance on them previously. If one did it was under $300. I still am currently unemployed & am having difficulty finding employement as a RN, due to my criminal record within the last year. If I had problems before taking antipsychotics, they were nothing compared to what I have now. I am only taking ativan & getting psychological therapy & trying to get out of the legal mess the drugs seroquel & abilify caused me. It definitely made my life now & in the future much, much worse.",Low

crestor,1,"crestor high cholesterol - None Over a period of several months, I got to a point where I ached so much in the morning that I could hardly get out of bed, I could control the pain with OTC painkillers. I had been able to carry a 40 pound bag of dog food easily, I got so that I could barely carry five pounds of groceries. I felt that I had aged about twenty years in a few months! I lucked out finding the answer in an online newsletter that warned Crestor users of this problem which the manufacturer claimed was ""very rare"". My doctor told me to stop it immediately, gradually I got better. I still cringe when I see Crestor advertised on TV or in a magazine...",Low
finacea,8,finacea acne - The occurance of medium to large acne on cheeks was almost non existant. There still was the occasional small white head and they generally healed quickly and left little to no scarring. There were no visible side effects that I was aware of.

lamictal,10,"lamictal seizure disorder - Total seizure control; however occasional auras continue none I have seizure disorder; for years I took Dilantin which was partly effective but not entirely and has some side effects.  Several years ago a new doctor wanted to change me to Trileptal.  The experience was not good - a major seizure while he was experimenting with the dosage; dizzy spells came over me in the morning, sometimes during my commute.  Later the doctor switched to Lamictal.  I have been on Lamictal for several years now with no seizures and no side effects, with the occasional 'aura' (something like a headache that in the past has sometimes been a precursor to a seizure).

I had slept wrong one night and caused major inflamation in my neck muscles. Nothing helped; massage, Tylenol, etc. This did work. It allowed me to sleep without pain and eventually my neck just healed itself.",high
alprazolam,10,"alprazolam panic disorder, agoraphobia - Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks. Barely any despite some slight confusion. This medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it. If people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet. 

Taken *as* prescribed or as-needed, this drug is wonderful.",high
lexapro,1,"lexapro depression - I felt less sadness. i felt less of every emotion.  i felt emotionally flat.  Slept a lot.  When I wasn't sleeping, I really could not even have driven a car.  Made me a zombie. I took a whole 10 mg tablet the first time and I wasn't right for two days.

celexa,3,"celexa depression and anxiety - Worked to well dry mouth, tired throughout the day, yawning, lack of wanting to go out. I was on 20mg celexa for about 6 months,  Ive suffered with depression and anxiety for some time now.  I was on wellbutrin for 2 years and loved it, but doesnt help much with anxiety, just more of depression.  So i tried celexa and loved it initially, but i guess you can say that i dint like it because it worked too well!  I completely changed.  I didnt care much about going out or what people and friends thought about me.  Im a contractor and started to get a feeling of not wanting to go on lots of bids or work long hours like i use to want to...which caused a big drop in income.  Paying bills at the last secound, started smoking again etc. I just had that 'i dont give a shyt about anything' attitude. For me this drug completely changed me for the worst.

Relief from restless leg syndrome. Ability to relax gradually over time. Relief from chattering teeth. none really. For years, after some kind of nerve damage after a spinal tap, I would start to have small seizures every time I would begin to relax. (GETTING TENSE DIDN'T HELP EITHER ;-) I had trouble laying quietly, let alone sleeping. My teeth chattered and my legs twitched like crazy and there was a very painful weak spot in my lower back. I still have the painful weak spot and pretty severe migraines, but this drug was a quality of life saver. When I took it at the same time as Topomax it was ESPECIALLY effective. I take 2 mg at night before bed, and sometimes another .5 or 1 mg during the day if symptoms were bad. It's exhausting to never be able to relax.",high

Prior to the patch I was on a sublinqual tablet but that wasnt working so I tried the patch. Te only side affect fromthe patch is severe appetite loss. Some days I have no desire to eat at all not even a craving. This is starting to concern me considering that I'm not trying to loose weight at all. Ive lost about 3 pounds already and about 115 pounds at 5ft tall so this is a problem. Wondering if anyone else has experianced this and have any suggestions? Spoke with the pharmacist and he stated that it may go away but try it for another month. He didnt sound to sure about it either.",high
zoloft,8,"zoloft depression - After about two weeks of being on the medicine, I started to feel a little better but I think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. The medicine has helped me by the following:
Lessened depression, better overall mood, slightly less irritable and sensitive, better able to function daily occasional headaches and nausea,occasional ticking noise in the back of my head, and decreased sex drive, I was diagnosed with severe depression after attempted suicide.",high
lexapro,7,"lexapro depression/anxiety - Lexapro worked very well to make me feel better, less anxious and unhappy. I gained ten pounds in the few months that I took this medicine. I've taken several anti-depressants over the years trying to find something with the least side effects for me. Paxil caused my jaw to always clench, Prozac caused heart flutters.

My doctor was very insistant that Lexapro was not the cause of my weight gain. However, I insisted on trying something else (Wellbutrin). Within 2 months I had lost the aberrant 10 pounds.",high

Getting rid of acnee spots very fast. Sun sensitivity, sensitivity of the skin, dehydration, tightness - they disappear after several months of constant use. 2-3 times x week",high
lexapro,7,"lexapro depression - Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means. The side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  I am drowsier on this drug than I was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  However, it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells. I have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  I prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as I divide the doses.  I am staying at 15 because I would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  I was happier overall on 20 mg however.  Oddly enough, taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and I found myself crying more.  All in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  However, for long term use I prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night.",high

I was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue. dosing is extremely important as it takes many blood tests to determine correct dosage.  Not having the dosage quite right will basically result in the same symptoms that you are having issues with.  I have suffered basically no significant side effects other than that. Pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  It is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  Symptoms that I experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  It's taken awhile to get the dosage correct, and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company, I feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others I had been taking for 5 years.",high

Everytime my skin flared up I would use it again.  I'm using it right now.  I can't really say if the Metrogel helped at all.

I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born. Wellbutrin can make me feel anxious, which is why I have a prescription for clonazepam whenever I am taking wellbutrin. The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss, as some others have, nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido. I tolerated it very well. I started to take wellbutrin xl at about six months of pregnancy and continued for approx six months, when the baby was about three months old. I usually took it in the morning, but often times forgot and took it later in the day. None of this seemed to affect how well it worked. Were it not for the fact that it is so expensive and that it can be toxic to the body, I would take it every day.

I had a minor operation on my foot and sufered a servere reaction to the anesthesia. they could not wake me up for 2 days. during this time i also had seizures. i began using this medication for back pain over a year ago.",high
valtrex,7,"valtrex cold sores - It definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now I get the more frequently.  Like twice a month!! ocassional diarrhea and headache. I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?",high
wellbutrin-sr,10,"wellbutrin-sr depression - It greatly helped with my depression which was caused by a divorce after 28 years of marriage. 3 months after my separation my Father died and my Mother became very angry and unresponsive with me.When I started taking this medication I was able to focus better at work and at home I was able to effectively deal with my emotions, I also experienced an increase in my libido. I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion). I took Wellbetrin XL for a little while, but I didn't like it because I felt like my emotions were on a rollercoaster ride. I went back to the generic form of Wellbutrin SR and I felt better, I would like to try the name brand of Wellbutrin since I have heard that it is actually better than the generic.I don't recall any bad side effects,except a little dry mouth. I take 1 tablet in the morning an 1 tablet at night everyday. When I am able to afford it I intend to try the brand name of this product to see if it will help with my libido now since I have had a hysterectomy and am experiencing low libido, weight gain, and depression of a different kind than I experienced in the beginning.",high
retin-a,3,"retin-a acne - I saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. I believe it exacerbated my acne. On the mornings after the nights I used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst). Side effects included:
- Stinging & pain
- Peeling
- Pinkness (exacerbated rosacea) The cream was supposed to minimize my acne, but I think it did the opposite. Just putting the cream on was very painful & stung up front. 

At times, my face would peel for entire days (again primarily on the chin - or entire jawline area). 

As I saw it, the Retin A reacted negatively with whatever hormonal issue was causing the acne. 

I was forced to use injestable treatments, because Retin A did not work (antibiotics and birth control).",Low
neurontin,6,"neurontin nerve damage - at the highest dosage, the generic, gabapentin, seemingly reduced nerve pain resulting from Peripheral Neuropathy following surgery to remove neuromas in both feet (although it is a very subjective pain, which is affected by other factors: tension, sitting for prolonged periods, etc.) after taking the highest dosage for a period of 1 year or so, the medication seems to have dried out and damaged my hair, and made my skin significantly drier and scalier. started at 300mg/day, gradually increased to 3600.  have since tapered off to 1200.",high
lorazepam,9,"lorazepam panic attacks - i could control my panic and knew i could. therefore, just having lorazepam with me was often enough. over the years, my attacks diminished, first in severity, then in quantity. drowsiness. i couldn't take it and then be expected to work. this could get tricky. one half to one pill at the first feelings of panic. better to let it absorb through the tongue for faster results.",high
vivelle-dot,9,"vivelle-dot hysterectomy - The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication. The only side effect I have experienced is that the patch leaves sticky stuff on your skin.  The adhesive can be very difficult to remove. Vivelle Dot is an Estrogen replacement patch that is placed on the abdomen every 3 1/2 days. It comes in several dose strengths.  It has significantly reduced my headaches due to hormone replacement.  He is also great for people who have trouble remembering to take a daily pill.  I highly recommend this product.",high
lexapro,4,"lexapro depression, lack of motivation - My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset. I did not gain or loose weight. My sex drive became non-existent. I was no longer able to achieve orgasm. This really became an issue only when my dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg. Ultimately, I stopped the pill because of this. Now, I am starting again (only 10 mg/day) because I am so lethargic, depressed, and full of obsessive thoughts. My dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg after about 2 months. I took the 20 mg dose for one month but then I abruptly stopped because of the side effects. I did not have any problem stopping the pill (no withdrawal symptoms at all). My sex drive and the ability to orgasm came back.",Low

relafen,5,"relafen sciatica - The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month. Excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug. The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.  It appears that eventually I will need to take medication but I want to avoid feeling ""doped up"" for as long as possible.",high
valium,6,"valium anxiety - It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience. Only mild slightly woozy feelings. Exacerbated when I took higher dose of 1 & 1/2 tablets This medication was prescribed to calm feelings of anxiety and nervousness that I experienced in certain social situations.",high
yasmin,10,"yasmin birth control - I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.

klonopin,1,"klonopin tia type seizures, stress - None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues. I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable. I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific, but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!",Low

provigil,7,provigil fatigue - Was often so tired that I barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days. No negative side effects Was prescribed 100 mg and could go up to 200 mg as needed.  On a regular day 100 mg was sufficient.  On long days or if I had activities schduled after work I would take another 100 mg tablet or I'd cut a tablet in half to take 50 mg rather than 100 .  I made sure I didn't take anymore after about 6:00 pm or it would keep me awake at night.,high
mirapex,10,"mirapex restless legs syndrome - My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies. I've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around. I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.  This keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because I used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or I'd feel the need to move.  I also take 1 mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  This has improved my quality of sleep immensely.",high

provera,9,"provera irregular menses - The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again. The only side effects I noticed were during the first two days or so of taking Provera I was more tired than usual.  I also noticed I felt more bloated than when I was not taking it. On day 15 of my cycle I took the Provera 10 mg for 12 days and then stopped to promote a period.  It took a couple of cycles for this to become effective, but utilizing the drug in this manner did take care of the problem of irregular bleeding in between periods.",high
adipex-p,9,"adipex-p weightloss - Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over. At first when I started the phentermine, it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  I also had trouble falling asleep at first if I didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. These side effects all diminished after about a month of usage. First I had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  I was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. I also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   They also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but I did not take those since I hate having to take any kind of pills.  Overall I am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when I feel myself getting off track again.",high

I gained weight, developed horrible acne, and i was severely depressed the entire time. When choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill, lightening or stopping my periods, and the guaruntee of contraception. Boy was i wrong. All of the previous side effects were bad enough, but after the first month on the shot, i continued to have my period for nearly 2 months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. The worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot, there is no going back. I highly recommend a different birth control. I am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. Mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint.

After getting off the shot it took nearly 2 years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (Depo was my first experience with birth control).

suboxone,10,"suboxone opioid addiction - Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life. My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet. I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable).",high

I do usually follow-up with yogurt or another form of pro-biotic after prescription antibiotics. Take 2 tablets the first day by mouth; then, one tablet on days 2-5.  Don't take medicine within one hour before or two hours after aluminum or a magnesium-containing antacid.  Finish all of the medication, even if symptoms of the illness disappear prior to full prescription time demands in length.  Store medicine @ room temperature, away from heat and light.  Medicine may cause sensitivity to sun; avoid exposure to sun.  Notify physician if swelling, rash or hives, breathing difficulties become present.  Do not do anything that could be dangerous (Ex:  driving, operating machinery) until you know how this medicine will affect you.",high

Lowered the dose and then increased it gradually instead, also splitting it into one dose in the AM and one in the PM, and the side effects disappeared. Patient had almost all the markers for Metabolic Syndrome X / Insulin Resistance.  Physician decided that Metformin might be help the Syndome X, plus it would have the added benefit of keeping patients slightly elevated morning blood glucose levels more stable.  It is not clear that the drugs had a large effect on most of the Syndrome X symptoms, however patient has been on the drug for 8 years and it reduced the AM blood glucose levels to a normal level.",high

Excessive prolonged coughing spells, especially at night, occasional diarrhea, isolated, patchy skin rashes on torso and extremities and itchy scalp all noticed within a week of starting this drug and has been persistent since.

EVENTUALLY, I DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND UNLIKE DENIALS FROM MANY DOCTORS, THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM WITHDRAWAL FROM THIS DRUG WERE HORRIBLE. I EXPERIENCED EXTREME ANXIETY, INTENSE SWEATING, AND TERRIBLE NIGHTMARES. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS BEFORE I BEGAN TO FEEL HUMAN AGAIN, EXCEPT FOR THE EXCRUATING PAIN FROM THE NEUROPATY IN MY BACK.

So far the throwing up has stopped and the headaches come and go no food even looks good to eat no cravings very easy to diet ;) and passing all my finals was AMAZING.

paxil-cr,9,"paxil-cr obsessive compulsive disorder - It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore. Getting on the drug was tough, because I endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain, but I was really skinny to begin with. I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack, which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference, though I still had moderate levels of anxiety, but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months, then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine, even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later, I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it, so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.  I look at is as nutrition for the brain, or like taking insulin for diabetes, it allows me function and enjoy life.",high
ativan,2,"ativan sleep problem - At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan. Loss of energy.  Huge increase in anger and irritability over seemingly non-issues.  Personality changes to being more depressed and pessimistic.  World view was negative, and everyone was an 'asshole'.  Did not want to do anything or try anything or go out.  Not even things normally that were turn ons ie. movies, dancing, sex, food
After 6-8months on the drug, it helped not at all and sleep was down to 1-2 hours per nite. Very simple, just take drug at night before bed.  Doctor prescribed for no more thatn 3 nights per week, but as sleep deprivation increased, so did the taking of the Ativan.  Sublingual helped better than pill.  Took drug up to 5 nights per week.  
Ran out of Ativan at some point and realized after a 3-4 days that was sleeping better and felt better mentally, emotionally and physically.  Realized that the drug had severely affected his personality and motivation.  sex drive and pleasure increased with each week off the Ativan.  Swore to never use it again because the difference in how he felt was like night and day, once he got off the pills.",Low

I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized. The drug made me nauseated the first month I took it. The only other significant ongoing side effect I experienced was constipation. I began taking Effexor XR when I was severely depressed. I took it once a day for approximately five years.  My symptoms included crying, lack of interest in life, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and sleeping more than usuual. I could barely get out of bed and I could not function. Within two weeks of beginning treatment with Effoxor, I began to feel take more of an interest in normal activities and was able to eat and sleep normally.",high

darvocet-n,8,"darvocet-n pain after surgery - The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more. During treatment I would get very weepy and depressed any time I was awake.  Of course I slept for hours after I would take it.  Other than those two things there were no side effects. I had surgery for endometriosis that left me in the hospital for over a week.  The doctor had to cut my stomach totally across the bottom to rid my body of the diseased tissue.  I'd been on morphine in the hospital, then came home taking the Darvocet for the next two weeks.",high
ranitidine,5,"ranitidine rash - Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment. None noted Rash of unknown origin.

If I skip the prevacid for any reason, I almost certainly will be very uncomfortable. It seems to give me a tendency to gain weight in the abdomen.  I did try some alternatives, including Nexium, which was not a good substitute at all! I have been on prevacid for approximately 6 years as a a prophylactic against the pre-barretts.  I have tried to slowly come off the drug (it is the only one I use) but I would venture to guess that unless I changed my diet significantly, this is not going to happen.",high
amoxil,10,"amoxil infection from grazing an ankle on coral - I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours. The drug upset my stomach mildly. Otherwise no side effects noticed. I was given a 3 day prescription which is the reason I am submitting this report. 
I believe antibiotics should be prescribed in a course of 7 - 10 days. 
This practice as far as I know was very popular in Hong Kong and it still might be general practice.
In my case I did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as I was not covered by medical insurance at that time.
Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.
The results were very positive and within 24 hours I could feel relief and I knew that the infection was being affected by the amoxilin. By the 3rd day the swelling was greatly reduced and other than a nasty wound on my ankle bone I felt very good. I continued the remaining 4 days and besides a scar on my ankle at the site of the infection I completely recovered.",high

They would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.

It took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  More importantly, the boils stopped forming. Made her sensitive to the sun, easily sunburned She was given an oral suspension (8 mg/mL trimethoprim and 40 mg/mL sulfamethoxazole) of which she needed to take 7 mLs 2 times a day for 10 days.

Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course. I think I remember not being able to taste very well.  But that could've been a side effect of the flu. And after taking Tamiflu the first time, I kinda remember being able to breathe more deeply than normal.  That effect wore off after a few hours.  Seemed to get used to the medication & didn't experience anything else. Prescribed Tamiflu for 5 days (one capsule twice daily).  Couldn't do anything buy just lay there.

I've been on a medically supervised diet to lose the weight I gained from the drug and have lost weight but not around my abdomen, it seems the Olanzapine can cause this type of weight gain.

valtrex,10,"valtrex genital herpes - After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days.

Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition. Peeling which can chafe the skin and interfer with putting on face makeup. However, I have built up such a tolerance, I would have to apply Retin-A 2-3 times daily to achieve major peeling. It is hard to measure the anti-aging effect, as I don't know what I would look like without having used Retin-A. I use once at night. Because I have built up a tolerance, I have no adverse side effects. If I do have occasional peeling, I remove/stimulate it with a Buff Puff.",high
relpax,10,"relpax migraine headaches - Relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea. Side effects were minimal.  I'd feel tired/lethargic following the initiation of it's effects, but the fatigue might be related to the Migraine headache rather than the drug (??).  I would sometimes get a ""rebound"" migraine headache of decreased intensity approximately 2 days after the treatment. Relpax was prescribed on an ""as needed"" basis for my migraines.  It was taken after the onset of migraine, usually when I realized that it would not go away via conventional over the counter headache medicines.  It starts to take effect at approximately 1-2 hours after I take the pill.  This medicine has been a ""life saver"" for me.  It allows me to function and go on with important things in my life even when I get a migraine.",high

When you take it be very careful that you do not misuse.

climara,8,"climara hot flash sleep problems - My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches. The only drawback to using the patch is a mild allergy to the adhesive.  Sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath, so I've had to pull out a new one.  I do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form, or at all, but with a uterus it is necessary.  I'm also concerned about long-term effects. I originally began using HRT 5 years ago to help with very severe menopausal symptoms.  I had tried all the natural remedies as I was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs, soy, etc.  I walked 30 miles a week and did yoga, none of which helped.  In desperation I visited my OB GYN who suggested I go on HRT, stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  Shortly, thereafter, the reports initial study was released, and again I spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  I switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective, and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  I've since weaned myself off several times, only to have the symptoms return.  I'm concerned about latest studies and have thought about weaning myself off again, and then think, ""quality of life"".",high

My doctor suggested I try Requip, and its been the best thing I have done. I have experienced no side effects, except sleeping at night.  The warning says that it might make you drowsy, but that's also why they say to take it at night. I take Requip about 1-1/2 to 2 hours before bedtime.

Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea",Low

celexa,8,"celexa depression, irritability - The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it. The side effects I experienced with Celexa were heart palpitations during the first few weeks of taking it, which later subsided.  Yawning was also a side effect, but it went away after a couple of months. I take 1 1/2 40 mg. tablets of Celexa once a day.",high
restasis,10,"restasis dry eyes - Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.

oxycodone,5,"oxycodone post surgery - benefits were the pain relieving benefits Side effects were a little troubling to me.  Although the pain was not diminished completely, I noticed that when I had severe pain, the meds did absolutely no good.  Perhaps if I'd taken more than the recommended dosage, it would have been effective, but I did not want to do that.  It also had a negative effect on my brain.  I could not think clearly, I felt like I was in a fog.  I also spent alot of time sleeping which was another side effect I did not like. Took this med following surgery for pain control.",high

buprenorphine,10,"buprenorphine major depression - Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication. None. I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve. I do this again at night as I get into bed. That's pretty much it!",high
fiorinal,5,"fiorinal tension headaches - It assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief. I had no side effects. I have severe tension headaches on a every other day basis.  Occasional swelling in the top of neck. if ibuprofen didnt do the job, fiorinal usually topped it off.  but this medicine alone didnt do much for me. I was prescribed 1 to 2 pills every 6 hours when headaches occurs.",high
doxycycline,4,"doxycycline acne - I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me. There was one morning I only had an 80 calorie granola bar for breakfast and I took my dose and I ended up having terrible nausea. Will never make that mistake again. So far my acne has improved. I'm hoping it goes away, my main message is to point out it did not treat my chlamydia.",Low
propecia,9,propecia hair loss - My hair loss was stopped and I eventually grew new hair at the hairline and where the hair had receded on the side. I do not know if it affected my crown. I noticed a slightly lowered libido and possibly a more slowly growing beard. My libido seems to be back to normal. I have to take 1mg/day to stop hair loss. I did not notice results until recently after having taken it for 6 months and I am hoping to notice even more once I have been on it for a year.,high
trazodone,10,"trazodone depression/difficulty sleeping - I took it before bed, and it helped me get to sleep. It also helped me cope during a difficult time emotionally. The drug is an anti-depressant. The side effect was sleepiness, which is also therapeutic when taken at night. Ongoing treatment for several years with 50 mg at bedtime.",high
zomig,9,"zomig persistant migraines - Elminated 95% of Migraines/Headaches! Within about 15-30 min, I start feeling mild tingling in my throat, back of my neck & chest. Its a little scary the first time, but it only lasts for about 10-15 min and then my migraine disappears with the side effects! No drowsiness or feeling groggy like others have complained of in my experience. I have found that it is more effective and works more quickly if I'm able to lay down in quiet when I ""feel"" it starting to work. My insurance covers it like a normal RX, but it only comes with 10 pills for the duration, but still worth every penny. I have tried ALL KINDS of other migraine meds, with absolutely no success. Zomig was my last hope without seeing a specialist (again) and trying combos of meds. Over the past several months, it has cured almost all of my migraines (it doesn't help sinus headaches, but does help alcohol induced headaches-I get them even after one glass of wine). The mild side effects are completely tolerable considering I'm only sacrificing 1 hour, at most now, as opposed to 1-2 days. I can be a real person again!!!",high

ortho-tri-cyclen,9,"ortho-tri-cyclen pregnancy prevention - Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period. For the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  When my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about 3 days.  The second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps. I take the sunday start pills everyday in the afternoon.",high
synthroid,8,"synthroid hypothyroidism - The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later. I had no side effects. I have since stopped taking the Levothyroxine 100 mics daily. My provider explained to me since I was still feeling tired was to switch to the brand name Synthroid 100 mics daily. I have noticed a big difference in my energy level and alertness. I can't believe I have gone this long (15 years) feeling tired and out of sorts. I wish now I had been taking the brand name all along. No telling what things I may acomplished.",high
elavil,7,"elavil depression/insomnia - This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily. The major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case, but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.  In addition, there is a dry mouth effect that seems to resolve after a month or two. This was prescribed by my psychiatrist after trying several newer hypnotics.  The newer medications such as Ambien and Lunestra caused sleep disturbances, particularly altered dreams states.  In the case of the latter, it is prohibitively expensive.",high
xalatan,8,"xalatan glaucoma - lowering of intraocular  pressure /keeping it under control A slight change in the coulour of the treated eye. My juvenile/pigmentary (open angle) glaucoma was diagnosed when I was 26 in 1989 (my mother also had it). I was prescribed 2 kinds of eye drops which were effective for some time, but after a while, they couldn't control the intraocular pressure in my left eye, so I had to undergo a trabeculectomy in 1992.

Sexual Funktion and feelings of prostate improved remarkable.

(Only 70% of improvement perhaps my personal problems were not solved with Ibuprofen - and such problem put a lot of stress on prostata in some men) There were hardly any noticeable side effects.
The only thing I had to care about, was to take the medicine (Ibuprofen) with food/ a meal because otherwise it would cause gastric problems.
And I took the second daily pill with dinner and left some ours before go to sleep.
Perhaps Ibuprofen causes a light drop in bloodsugar - but I�m not definitely sure about that. I had a bakterial prostatitis in the winter (likely from a combination of psychological and personal stress, bike riding in very cold conditions).
But also before the bacterial prostatitis I had a very sensitiv Prostate and often sensual problems.

Throughout treatment: Insomnia and disrupted sleep patterns, some dizziness at times, muscular twitching, fidgeting and spasming, weight loss due mostly to fidgeting all the time

lexapro,8,"lexapro depression - I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms. Initially the medication made me very drowsy. I began taking it at bedtime, which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  I think there may have been some weight gain, but I am not certain that it was specifically related to the Lexapro. Also, I did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm, but this side effect seemed to diminish within 6-9 months. I'm not sure waht you mean here- I started on the medication over 2 years ago at 10 mg a day. The dosage was increased to 20 mg after about 12 months.  The side effects were limited, and mostly not perticularly bothersome.",high

It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach. Virtually no side effects, other than very slight drowsiness several hours after taking it...almost not noticeable. I was on a very small dose.  And I only took this when I felt I needed it.  It was a life saver and kept my body from experiencing intense stress like shaking, heart palpitations, and emotional upset.  It did not change my mood.

It then worsened and she was coughing day and night. She couldn't even sleep. It became so severe she was coughing all the time, when she talked when she ate. It was exhausting and debilitating, the cough was killing her. She then thought it was some lung problem, although she is not a smoker.  She went to the Dr and Dr did a few allergy test and lung x rays.  Well, then finally Dr checked high blood pressure medication.  Yes, of course!!! it was the medication.

I actually have one testicle now smaller than the other.  I pray everyday that the pain will go away and that my buddies will come back but I dont think they will.  As for penile shrinkage, imagine a button on a sweater.  This drug is poison and Im looking for a class action suit.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!! 1mg a day",Low
tri-luma,8,"tri-luma acne, melasma - lightning of dark pigments some dry skin especially under eye area Applied once at night as directed.  Applied sunscreen in morning of SPF 30.  Some dark pigmentation was lightened significantly but some places didn't lighten enough to go unnoticed.  Acne was not helped, suprisingly, but the treatment did not make it worse either. Overall skin appearance looked more uniform.",high
triphasil,10,"triphasil contraception - General Medical:  The treatment is for contraception.  I used it for weight control, skin problems and as a contraception, it was very effective for all of it except that when i left the medication I experienced severe hair loss which i was not warned about severe hair loss after terminating the pill, but no others whilst on it Daily dose usually taken at night",high
cipro,1,"cipro possible uti - none...I am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since I had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and I would be telling a bald faced lie if I said there were and but I will keep on typing so that I comply with the request for the fifty word minimun severe heart palpitations
severe panic attack involving racing morbid thoughts with fear of dying

I also suffered head aches and leg and foot cramps and this was from only three 500 mg doses which is very scarey in my opinion Cipro was started while waiting for the results of a urine culture after it was found that I had blood in my urine and I had a high white blood cell count in the urine specimen. The thought was I had a severe infection so she opted to hit it hard with the most potent medicine available",Low
celexa,8,"celexa depression - when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. Never forget it, a fantastic feeling.Truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.I have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own. quite severe night sweats and yawning,dry mouth,ejaculation disorder (not always a bad thing) not sure what you mean by this. Was in relationship counceling and the psycologist suggested I was depressed as well as stressed. she suggested citalopram. saw my gp who prescribed it. never looked back. I did slide back in to depression a couple of years after first taking the drug but recognised the symptoms and got another script from my doctor with the same positive results.",high

clonazepam,10,"clonazepam anxiety insomnia - reduction of anxiety, better sleep quality, reduced gi symptoms (stress related) Drowsiness in the morning. Initially this drug was prescribed short term for a significant life crisis.  I did not use it much as such, I did not feel short term effects for daytime use.  I did, however, learn that taking 1 mg prior to bed would better the quality of my sleep, stop me from waking up in the middle of the night with anxiety and allow me to sleep longer. Overall, this improvement in sleep quality allowed me to function better in the daytime thus allowing me to deal with the stressors on hand.  I have reduced the dose to .5 mg nightly with the same effects and less morning drowsiness.  I intend to continue to lower the dose until I am off it entirely.  That said, if the sleep disorder/anxiety returns, I will not hesitate to return to using the drug.  Hope this helps someone.",high
zoloft,7,"zoloft depresson/anxiety - It works very well for anxiety. As for depression, it works but when I get into an episode of MAJOR depression, it seems to be somewhat ineffective at those times. Dry mouth When one of my past psychiatrists tried to get me off of Zoloft, I was okay for a while, but then after a month or so I developed considerable anxiety and depression and had to get back on Zoloft for that to subside. In other words... Zoloft is highly addictive when you have considerable anxiety/depression.",high
motrin,9,"motrin severe headache - Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did. There did not seem to be any side effects of the ibuprofen. I almost always tried to make sure and eat something or drink milk when taking the medication as indicated to take with food.  I didn't experience any problems even when taking the maximum dosage suggested, 3 within a 24 hour period. I get severe headaches about every two or three months that can last for three to four days.  Sometimes the most sever headaches seem to be what I call a combination headache, wherein I may be experiencing the routine headache associated with premenstrual cycle but may also be effected by sinus or seasonal weather/ pressure changes or tension headache.  It seems the hardest to treat is the combination of the premenstrual headache with the sinus headache.  I often took both ibuprofen and an over the counter sinus headache medication with some effectiveness.  There have been a few times when nothing took the headache away all day and I may even vomit just from the pain. Some severe headaches were accompanied by sensitivity to light, noise or even smells.",high
vyvanse,7,"vyvanse focus - .. .. I am 27, When I was in 9th grade I became ill with lyme disease. It was so severe that I was out of school for two years, and instead of going back to school and graduating HS at the age of 20 I got my GED and joined the Army. I had a MOS that did not require much thinking on your own. And because of that I was very successful. I made rank quick, was very respected, became the NCO of the year twice, became a Drill Sgt. and because of all my military success I had no problem getting into a tier one college. out of all my deployments and undescribable situations Ive been in, nothing compared with the stress of college. once identifying that I had a learning problem. I was prescribed Vyvanse.
I am now going into my senior year and I am ranked in the top 5% of my class. Vyvanse has given me focus and direction. With the good comes the bad. I have lost alot of muscle(I think it all went to my brain). I become aggressive and some times its hard to put into check before I lose control.
and I always have the desire to drink alcohol. For the most part I am able to have self control, but its not easy. I plan on continuing Vyvanse through Grad school. I would recommend this drug, You just need to have a good sense of self awareness, and keep your eye on the prize.",high

provigil,9,provigil fatigue / malaise due to infections - Provigil allows for better wakefulness in the daytime which in turn assists in better sleep. It also indirectly boosts mood by allowing some level of function during a chronic illness where things can easily spiral downward. There were no side affects until reached 600 mg / day.  This is above the normal dose but within dosing guidelines. It was a shot in the arm without any side affects. It is NOT a magic bullet but can provide some relief in a chronic situation.,high

Also in the morning if I notice red spots it seems to help. none rub into red areas 1-2 times a day",high
maxalt,9,"maxalt migraines - After about an hour, headaches disappear. This drug works better for me than other drugs taken before the year 2000, such as Imitrex and Zomig which I took for migraines. Imitrex sped up my heart which scared me. Zomig took 2 hours to work for me.
Maxalt changed my life as I finally am able to function instead of wasting a whole day in a dark room in tears from the pain of migraine. I do not miss work days anymore. Dry mouth and increased appetite which is preferable to the throbbing head pain and nausea of migraine.
Sometimes I feel a bit sleepy but not so much that I cannot function or drive. Maxalt is more gentle on my system than Imitrex and Zomig. On rare occasions, I have to take 2 Maxalt in a 24 hour period. I do not feel addicted in any way. I always carry Maxalt with me just in case. Works best at first sign of migraine. In the 70's and 80's I just had to suffer from the pain and miss work days and cry in a dark room. I would take OTC sleep aids just to escape the agony. Found a Dr who prescibed Imitrex about 1989 which helped, but then in the late 90's my new doctor who also was a migraine sufferer suggested I try Maxalt and it has been what I prefer. My headaches are fewer now, probably because of Menopause which I am now using bio-identical hormones, biest and progesterone.",high
naproxen,10,"naproxen arthritis - I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear. None noticed One 500mg tablet twice a day",high
antivert,10,"antivert dizzyness,, vertigo, nausea, - Restored me from total incapacitation to a full function. Some drowsiness until I got used to it.  The side effects are totally insignificant compared to the benefits.  I usually take 50 mg at bedtime. The side effect of slight drowsiness is actually beneficial as I get to sleep faster and can function the next day with out the horrendous effects of dizziness, vertigo and nausea. I had my first episode of incapacitating dizziness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting in about 1972. I was a practicing Orthopedic Surgeon at the time. I was bed, flat on my back for about two weeks, when a fellow M.D. prescribed meclizine for me. Within a few days I was back at work, fully functional.  Since then I have ad about three significant episodes of acute dizzy, nausea and vertigo.  Each as been less severe.  At the onset I take as many 50 mg meclizine tablets as I need to stop the process in its tracks. That can be up to 6 to 8 tabloids.   Once the ephisode passes, usually in a fe days, I go back to my routine of one tablet at night. This drug has been a true godsend for me.",high
tylenol,10,"tylenol headache - I believe that there are multiple treatment benefits of Taking Tylenol for my headache. Tylenol is safe, inexpensive, and does not require a physicians prescription. Additionally, it is available almost everywhere and therefor is convenient. There were no treatment side effects from me taking Tylenol for my headache. There are no deatails to report. My headache was gone within 30 minutes.",high
xanax,9,"xanax anxiety - Reduced panic attacks, in combination with Lexpro. Particularly effective when taken an hour before panic inducing situations, such as flying. Sleepiness; feeling ""out of it"" or not quite connected. It is not possible to work or drive when on the medication. Must be taken at night or when you don't need to perform (such as on long flights).

flonase,8,"flonase nasal allergy - For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back! I experienced no side effects at all from this nasal spray. This was great  because I had significant side effects from all the pills I had ever tried for my hay fever/nasal allergies (dry mouth and drowsiness). One or two squirts of the spray into each nostril once a day during allergy season.",high
wellbutrin,6,"wellbutrin depression - The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression. Unfortunately, the drug seemed to correlate with an increased severity of a pre-existing condition: tinnitus. The tinnitus which was moderate to begin with became severe and ultimately led me to stop taking the medication. The tinnitus, though still present, is markedly less severe and decreased almost immediately after stopping the medication. I was prescribed Wellbutrin, was on it for approximately 5 months and gradually stopped over the course of a few days.",high

prozac,8,"prozac depression - Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks. There was a decreased ability to have orgasms and a general numbing not quite stupor in which I existed. There was also a major decrese in appetite. This drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over 20lbs - I went from 128 to 108 lbs. The weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. The drug was effective in that I no longer felt depressed per se, but then I didn't feel much of anything. Any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!",high
allegra,8,"allegra hives - the hives were controlled afternoon tiredness and sleepiness I usually do not experience. I am to take this in the morning daily.  I am afraid to stop it because I fear the hives will return, but the sleepiness and lethargy in the afternoon is not pleasant.  I am considering cutting the tablet in two.

fexofenadine,2,"fexofenadine allergic rhinitis - There were no benefits as the sniffling, dripping, coughing continued even on the medicine. Dry mouth.

The only side effect was being a little dry.",Low
lunesta,10,"lunesta ptsd/insomnia - For years I was sleep deprived due to working conditions.  Rarely would I enjoy the luxury of a full night sleep. Typically I would take hours to get to sleep and had extreme difficulty remaining asleep. Dreams were too realistic and often I would be more tired in the morning than upon retiring to bed. Taking Lunesta has allowed me not only to get to sleep but return to sleep.  If I wake in the middle of the night, for example to go to the bathroom, I am awake and not stumbling. The vivid dreams are gone and I have experienced no groggy or hungover symptoms that you sometimes hear of when taking sleep medication. 
It has truly changed my life and I am so grateful for my Dr. for his prescription. It has been over a year and I have yet to see any side effects, other than increasing the dosage from 2-3mg. One tablet, taken each night when I was already in bed and ready for sleep.",high

lipitor,10,"lipitor high cholesteral - It lowered my cholesteral considerably.  My total cholesteral was over 300 and my LDLs were over 200, but after being on Lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now 186 and my LDL is 86, so I am in good shape.  In addition, I have experienced NO side effects whatsoever, so I am pleased.  The only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $40.00 per month. I experienced NO side effects whatsoever.  I have been on many medications over the last 10 years and normally experience at least some small side effect, but have not with Lipitor.  I do get my liver function tested every few months, and so far it has been fine.  This is not a problem for me as the benefits outweigh any hassle of getting tested. I take 10 mg of Lipitor daily and get a liver function test every three months.  So far, this has been fine, but I will need to be tested continually as long as I take Lipitor.  I don't mind this, as the benefit of having a healthy cholesteral level is more important to me than any hassle of getting tested.  If at some point my liver function appears to be unhealthy, I'm guessing my doctor will have to reevaluate my situation, but for now, it's fine.",high

Took this when i had idiopathic urticaria and angiodema. At first it wsa prescribed inthe short term to try to ""Dampen"" my immune system but it didnt help.

ventolin-hfa,1,"ventolin-hfa asthma - None Increased difficulty breathing, strange taste. I have a prescription for albuterol for sports related asthma. I usually get the Proair inhaler but the pharmacist insisted this was the same and gave it to me. The first day I had it, I went for a run. As usual, about 10 minutes in my chest begins to tighten and I cannot breath. I took a puff of the Ventolin HFA inhaler. No effect. I stopped running. I took another puff. No effect. Still cannot breath. I am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. I took several more puffs from the inhaler. No effect. I am now struggling to remain conscious, I am getting light headed and everything in my vision is pale. I begin to lay on my back, taking a few more puffs of the inhaler. No effect. My throat is now beginning to seize from the sheer force it takes to inhale tablespoon-sized breaths. I have a headache and hear a high pitched whining. I try several more puffs of my inhaler. No effect. I lay on the ground doing controlled breathing for several minutes. I tried a puff of Ventolin HFA here and there with no effect, so I gave it up. I'm laying wondering if this is my last day on Earth. About 15 minutes of pure agony later I catch my breath slightly. I now have an enormous headache and am dizzy. I get to my feet and start to walk toward my apartment (across the street). Along the way, my chest seizes up a couple more times, and a couple more times I use the inhaler. No effect. I now have to wait another month before I can afford a ProAir inhaler before I can even exercise again. I think Ventolin is for underdeveloped little kids who think they have asthma but actually don't. I have real asthma and this stuff almost killed me. The puff that comes out of it is nearly invisible, the puff from a Proair inhaler is actually noticeable and...a 'puff'--about 15x more comes from the Proair compared to the Ventolin. Even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness I have then, Ventolin does nothing for. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I wheeze before AND AFTER I use the Ventolin. Well, it's because it doesn't work for me--in fact, it almost killed me. Everything in this story is true, but I may have taken more puffs from the inhaler than I listed...any ?'s feel free to contact me: thecrookfromthebrook at yahoo.com. Thank you and take care.",Low

flonase,7,"flonase congestion - I have rhinitis almost all year long. Usually it gets worse in the cold season. I have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don�t work for me at all. This nasal spray clears the congestion in 10 minutes, doesn't last for the whole night, but the pretty pleasant smell make me feel good. as any other drugs that suppress the immune system, I believe the fluticasone Propionate nasal spray is also make people more susceptible to infections than health individuals. But I guess if the congestion is so bad that one cannot get a quality sleep, it does more harm than the side effect of the nasal spray. I started using it right before last Christmas, hoping to get better before the holiday. It cleared the congestion for the a few hour after the first time I used it. I keep using it twice a day. for about five days and my nose became much less stuffy and less runny. I didn't completely treat my rhinitis, but I could sleep better. I am happy with the result.",high
ambien,7,"ambien insomnia - Definitely made me fall asleep. Very fast acting, about 10 minutes after taking it, I feel groggy. MEMORY LOSS. If you don't go to sleep immediately after feeling groggy, you will continue on with your life unbeknownest to you! I called people I never call, ate lots of food, watched movies, and had conversations, all of which I haven't the slightest recollection of. 
It is my belief that the long term memory effects must parallel the short term. 
Also I experienced vivid nightmares and hallucinations.

Visually there is no more loss.  I don't know if it is growing back, but as long as it stays i'm cool... I havent had any side effects that people have claimed, and erectile function is normal.

At work, I just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. As soon as I got home around 6pm, I had to go to bed. It was ridiculous. I just started treatment for severe depression.

cymbalta,7,"cymbalta dystimia - When you are in a mild depression or dystimia the worst thing is that you are unable to think or concentrate, you feel sleep and tired all the day. It's like 
having a permament cloud in your mind. I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind, I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly. The most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. I take deprax to induce sleep but even with it I woke up very early. You can get used to some side effects like dry mouth, vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor, although not serious, is very noticeable. I experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now. The treatment consists of Cymbalta 60mg and Deprax 50 mg, but it has been changed many times. The most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. I tried with Loramet and Diazepam but their effect last too much, it's impossible to concentrate. Deprax 100mg is the best I've taken to sleep. Now I'm taking just 50mg and I don't fall sleep so quick but it's fine, I have enough rest.",high
prevacid,9,"prevacid acid reflux - I can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  My condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  With prevacid, I eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  I have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  With religious use of prevacid, this rarely occurs.  I can eat a larger variety of foods. It has made a positive difference in my quality of life. I have not experienced negative physical side effects that I am aware of.  This drug does not aid with digestion of food.  I still have nausea and vomitting but, not because the drug doesn't work.  My doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating. I have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  I have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  With prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) I can eat and drink with less nausea.  Without it, my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  It has made a tremendous positive difference.  I do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  It is not a treatment for the paresis.  Reglan is the only FDA approved prescription drug for my condition that I am aware of.  I cannot use it without horrible side effects.",high
sumatriptan,9,"sumatriptan migraines - got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name.

I have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and I attribute it primarily to the Pentasa. I don't feel as though I have any discernible side-effects with Pentasa, but when paired with Purinethol I do have side effects such as extreme fatigue and headaches, leading me to believe the problem lies with the Purinethol. I do have intermittent constipation, which could be attributable to a number of factors in my life, but is also a side-effect of Pentasa. I also have mild headaches, muscle pain, and anxiety which are listed as possible side-effects with Pentasa, but to the best of my knowledge these symptoms were occuring prior to my starting Pentasa.  Perhaps the Pentasa exacerbates the problems, I don't know.  I know that I do worry about kidney problems, which is one of the more serious side-effects of this medicine. Twelve years ago I became ill with what was diagnosed two years later (!) as Crohn's disease.  I have used a variety of medications, ranging from more serious drugs (Prednisone, Remicade)to less ""harmful"" drugs (Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Asacol, etc.). I have been on the Pentasa for about 8 years, during which time I was using Purinethol for several years.  A year or so ago I weaned myself off of the Purinethol and remained on the highest dose of Pentasa for my weight, and I am doing well (knock on wood).  I have constipation issues as opposed to my previous diarrhea problems, which may be attributable to the Pentasa, and is manageable through diet and over-the-counter aids.",high
cytomel,10,"cytomel hypothyroidism - I am now wide awake--for the first time in YEARS!!!  My body aches have lessened greatly.  I am alert.  I can keep up with the housework.  I have a better memory, concentration, and overall mood.  I have regained my creativity.  My appetite/desire to overeat has decreased, though I still have an appetite.  I just eat like a normal person, now.  I don't suffer from emotional or boredom eating.  I am steadily losing weight--8 lbs. so far.  I also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that I couldn't do before.  I feel like someone handed me my life back! It took time to figure out when to take the medicine.  From everything I've read, I am supposed to take it in the morning.  But, that made me wide awake, even at night, and it interfered with my meal schedule.  So, now I take it around 11 P.M.  I still sleep well, something new for me, and can easily wake up, feeling alert throughout the day.  I've NEVER felt this way before.  It's awesome! Synthroid--50 mcg. + Liothyronine--25 mcg., both daily, around 11 P.M.
+
magnesium--400 mg. + Vitamin D3 (alternating between 2000 mg. and 4000 mg.), daily   (My body's not absorbing the Vit. D3 very well--will get rechecked in a week.)

Have these levels checked by your doctor.  90% of people are deficient in Vitamin D and low in magnesium.  These are essential to your body's wellness.",high
cipro,7,"cipro epidimytis - Got rid of my raging epidimytis and prostatitis. The pain started to subside within 2-3 days. Within the first week almost all symptoms were gone. Minor symptoms persisted until the 11-12 day. By the 14th day all symptoms were gone. BUT - the side effects were awful. Let it be known that I have been treated once before with ciprofloxacin, where I experienced no side effects. This time was a little different...

- muscle pains in thighs, chest, and traps. 
- tightness of chest 
- joint pains - specifically on the outsides of my knees. some pain in wrists, elbows, and upper back.
- semi severe pain in lymph nodes of neck w/ little to no swelling.
- complete anxiety that i had lympoma; both swollen lymph nodes and anxiety are side effects of Cipro
- general anxiety
- made me poo a lot. (kinda funny in retrospect)
- low sex drive
- pain in lower rib cage, a little higher than the kidneys. could not identify weather muscular or otherwise.
- pain in diaphragm
- pain in neck
- pain in upper jaw (only experienced this once for about an hour)
- pain in jaw would often radiate to pain in temples
- ringing in ears/dulled hearing (this would last for about 5 minutes at a time)
- very slight muscle twitching (only sometimes)
- i would get ""pins and needles"" very easily
- i was colder than normal for the entire two weeks
- i was very irritable - but i can't decide if my short temper was a side effect of the drug, or if it was caused by the drag of having so many side effects.

Other than the frequent bowel movements, I had no stomach or nausea problems. My bowel movements were very normal, and stomach aches were never an issue. 

All of the side effects became persistently worse, starting off as very minor side effects and progressing to a moderate stage. Some of the side effects (particularly the lymph node pain) didn't start until the second week. 14 days of this crazy drug solved my infection, but the side effects were killer. Ask your doctor about alternatives before starting ciprofloxacin.",high
clarithromycin,1,"clarithromycin strep throat - Immediately took the pain from the Strep away. Terrible taste in mouth, 4 and a half hours of constant dry-heaving, painful and sudden headaches, body aches. The side effects were so terrible, never felt so badly in my entire life. WOuldnt recommend for anyone unless they have a strong stomach",Low
citalopram,10,"citalopram anxiety disorder - I sufffered from dibilatating panic attacks, but they only lasted 15-20 minutes max. I was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. It got to where I had an attack at least every other day. The Citalopram kicked in in about 2 weeks and I've had only 1 episode since, granted I've only been on it for 2 months but it has worked wonders for me. None that I have noticed. 20 mgs. once a day.",high
prozac,6,"prozac depression - Less depressed, I could consintrate on daily life better. I was happier, less anxious, stopped worrying so much. I felt manic at times, surreal. I was thirsty a lot, and forgot to eat. I was suppose to take 20mg daily for treatment of depression, it helped my depression but i often felt manic and 'not myself'",high
prozac,1,"prozac pms - none, I felt worse. This is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact I felt much much worse. Unfortunately, I didn't review the contraindications. I got a rash on the back of my neck that lasted for 1 year even though I only took Prozac for 2 months. Also, I couldn't sleep as a result of taking Prozac. It seemed like after I stopped taking it I still had it in my body because I couldn't get rid of the rash on my neck and it was very annoying. Thhis is the first time that anything like this has ever happened to me. i took it once a day for PMS",Low
valtrex,7,valtrex herpes - To lessen the severity of an onset or outbreak of genital herpes. I had no noticable side effects to taking the medication. I started taking the medication at the first signs of an outbreak (usually a brief sharp pain at the site). The medication seemed to shorten the actual outbreak time and lessened the pain and discomfort.,high
klonopin,4,klonopin anxiety - Less depression.  Had more energy to do things.  Able to get involved in activities that I would otherwise not engage in. Had daytime drowsiness.  Constipation.  Had to take a stool softner on a daily basis.  Lowered my blood pressure a little.  Slowed my heartbeat a little bit. Increased appetite.  I gained twenty pounds in a little over two years.  It slowed my metabolism.  I could eat one low calorie meal in a day and not lose one pound. I would see a psychiatrist once a month.  The doctor would ask me how I was feeling and would change the dosage if neccesary.,Low
citalopram,7,citalopram depression - I feel that the citalopram helps keep me calm. I no longer have mood swings as often. No longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. No longer want to leave work because of depressed moods. First 2 days wicked nasea. I do sweat more than usual. Trouble sleeping at times. I started taking 20mg pills for a few months. I noticed that it would feel as though it was wearing off by 7pm or so. My doctor prescribed me up to 30mg for a week and then to 40mg for the rest of the month. Things seem better than on the 20mg. However I still get depressed at times and nothing seems to ever go right. Perhaps therapy will help which my doctor mentioned. Going to continue on the 40mg for a few more months and see if it helps if not I will make another apt at the doctor and see what she thinks weather we want to try and up the dose or try something different.,high
zoloft,9,"zoloft depression - Highly motivated vs my previous state of, ""why do I get up in the morning""? Nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person. Harder to climax, although I didn't necessarily lose interest in sex drive. Went off of it once I felt better- I have been off of it for about 6 months and feel good still.",high
chantix,10,"chantix smoking - WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist. mild constipation but relieved with fiber rich diet and liquids, strange taste and some deja vu/strange mental sensations. Cocaine Antagonist (positive) I took this drug with the intentions of quitting smoking. I also however, discovered on accident that this drug just about completely blocked the euphoric effects of cocaine and then subsequently blocked the ""crash"". All that would be experienced was a racy heart and undesirable ""too much caffeine"" feeling with nausea. This drug has a SERIOUSLY powerful effect on the euphoric of stimulants and needs to immediately be put into treatment plans for stimulant abuse. For Its indications, nicotine, It definately does its job here too my cravings for nicotine are pretty much extinguished though there still seems to be slight reward in an occasional cigarette, just goes to show how much I feel this drug stabilized my ADHD downsides such as deficient dopamine function in my brain. It worked better than bupropion. I understand Chantix has some issues with side effects but hopefully they will work those kinks out because this really looks to be a miracle drug.",high

elidel,7,"elidel skin rash - It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues. None Apply thin layer twice per day.   Non oily, cream based formula.",high
climara,10,"climara menopausal - Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch. The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal. After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.",high
lyrica,8,"lyrica fibromyalgia - I feel alot less pain taking the Flexeril (only at night) and the Lyrica. I feel sleepy and have days where in have trouble concentrating. For Fibromyalgia, in the morning I take half of a multi-Vitamin and 50mg of Lyrica. 5 days out of 7 days, I excercise for 20 to 30 minutes on a tredmill. In the evening, I take half a multi-Vitamin, 100mg of Lyrica, and 5mg of Flexeril",high
seroquel,8,"seroquel bipolar ii - Seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression. Dry mouth, vivid dreams (I remember most of my dreams from the past 5 years), extreme lethargy (the Wellbutron helps counteract that) I currently take 200 mgs at night before bed along with 200 mgs of Lamictal and Wellbutron. No therapy anymore.",high
prevacid,10,"prevacid excess stomach acid. - Reduced acid production to normal levels. At prescribed level of 30 mg/day I suffered fatigue and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. At half this dose I was fine. But, needed dosage levels are different for different people. The secret of taking proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors lies in finding the right dosage and the right time of day to take it. Zoton Fast Tabs are tablets which dissolve on the tongue and can be broken to alter the dosage. I found that half my prescribed dosage of 30 mgs/day was enough for me and so break the tablet in two.",high
proscar,9,"proscar bph - my urination problems (urgency , frequency , etc ) practically disappeared and I no longer had get off my bed to urinate several times during the night there were none I took one pill a day every evening with a glass of water after dinner .The treatment was supervised by a proctologist",high
seroquel,9,"seroquel bipolar disorder / insomnia - Initially I was prescribed it to knock me the hell out after 4 days of beautifully manic insomnia. Then after the mixed episode ended they spiked the dose over the course of a few months to 300, where it sits. 

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect. I'm very slow to get going in the morning. I often hit my snooze alarm 10-12 times (only 5 minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm 3 hours before I have to be anywhere.

The worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where I can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. Combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. I've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until I go unconscious and stop caring.

Also, something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. Not like heart-chest pain (from what I'd imagine it's like), but a different pain. Hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly. Dec 08- Zoloft, sparked a 3 week long mixed phase with psychotic features. 4 days into it I was prescribed 25 mg seroquel.

Jan 09-April 09, Increasing doses of Seroquel, up to 300. Also Wellbutrin, starting at 50 and eventually reaching 300. The wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than I was before, and I stopped taking it. Since then it's been the seroquel, and I've been mostly stable since.",high
danazol,7,"danazol ovarian cyst - After a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. It was a few cm big. By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then. It stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. But the worst side effect for me was I got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. Not only that, I noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. It took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. Hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. And another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. I gained about 8kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face. The treatment was easy enough. The gynaecologist prescribed Danazol for the ovarian cyst I had and it was very effective. The cyst was gone and didn't come back too.",high
celexa,8,"celexa depression/panic disorder - I'm only four days in, but I already feel more like myself than I have in a year and a half.  The effects were almost immediate.  I've taken more responsibility, had more energy, and been more outgoing already.

ditropan,8,ditropan incontinence - The medicine has stopped her wetting both day and night and worked within a week of her taking it. She is over the moon and so am I! My daughter complains of a pain in her bladder area and some constipation and her face looks a little flushed. I am considering lowering the dose to 2x 2.5ml per day She has had 4 years of bladder infections and has had various scans and tests. I think that she has never been able to read the signals from her bladder properly due to all the infections. This medicine which was prescribed by the dr on a trial basis seems to be working well.

tramadol,8,tramadol arthritis - When I began taking Tramadol I had severe Arthritis pain and could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. Tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. I had to take up to 6 tylenol or 4 ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain. There was mild drowsiness in the beginning or with taking the full allotted doses but no other adverse side effects. I take 2-4 Trmadol daily for my arthritis pain. Always 1 before bed and one upon waking if I begibn to feel pain during the day I may take another. my blood levels are monitored every 6 months to make sure there is no liver damage from this and/or the Ibuprofen I take.,high
permapen,1,"permapen viral bronchitis - Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.  Would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment. No side effects at all, just took an antibiotic I did not need and do not see any health benefit in that at all Doctor diagnosed me with Viral Bronchitis after and xray.  He then prescribed Penicillin to treat it.  Worthless treatment, since Penicillin is totally ineffective to fight a virus.",Low
trimethobenzamide,9,"trimethobenzamide vertigo - The trimethobenzamide significantly reduced nausea and brought it down to a perceptible but comfortable level. None. After being diagnosed with temporary vertigo, I was given prescriptions for this plus Meclizine for dizziness. The two combined brought the vertigo completely under control. There were no side effects. I took the medication as originally prescribed for two days and then, at my doctor's suggestion, reduced the amount to as-needed. The trimethobenzamide made it possible to eat normally, with no uncomfortable feelings of nausea.",high
cymbalta,8,"cymbalta anxiety and depression - a feeling of caring but not really caring. I feel like i become emotionally involved to deeply and this drug has kept me on the ""surface"" for lack of a better term. dry mouth and nausea for first 4 days. started taking at night only and didn't notice if it was making me tired, switched to day and seems to make me feel as if i need a nap but i am studying biology right now. might switch to nights again 30mg once a day for 2 weeks, then 60mg",high
valtrex,8,"valtrex cold sores - If drug is taken at very first sign/symptom of cold sore, the drug will elliminate it within that day. If the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). This medication is not a cure for cold sores. I have not noticed any side effects and have been taking this drug for a couple of years. It is important to note, there is no cure for cold sores (herpes). I don't know how the drug works but it seems if I am run down over the course of several weeks I may have to take the drug several times to keep a cold sore from surfacing. When you first feel a cold sore coming on take 4 pills with water, wait 10 to 12 hrs and then take another 4 pills. I have heard of people taking a daily maintenace dose that should ensure you never see a break out of blisters appearing, however, if not on a drug program, this would be very expensive, and depending on how many times you tend to break out, probably not necessary.",high
synthroid,3,"synthroid hypothyroidism after thyroidectomy - Had to take a thyroid replacement, so it did that, but not as well as I would have expected. Was very tired, had memory problems, weight gain.  Had trouble moving around, joint pain. Synthroid was prescribed as thyroid replacment hormone after total Thyroidectomy due to nodules, etc from Graves disease.  Was determined that 75 mcg was the correct dose.  However after 2 years of taking Synthroid and endocrinologist unwilling to try alternative medication, I found another doctor who did some additional testing.

tirosint,1,"tirosint hypothyroidism - No improvement at all in symptoms. Over the past few months I have developed borderline hypertension, increased bruising, my hair texture and skin continue to worsen. At 14 I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and this was corrected through medication (thyroid disorders are prevalent in my mother's family).

prednisone,10,"prednisone hives - This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up.

paxil,10,"paxil depression - I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life. I am not sure if it is only the drug but I have almost no sexual feelings. Could just be my age...who knows. I'm not sure what you mean by ""treatment details"" but I saw a psycotherapist for several months and she prescribed the paxil and ok'd the paroxetine.  I share my treatment with anyone because I think that depression is not the best descriptive word for what was troubeling me.  Thanks for your work!",high
solodyn,7,"solodyn acne - Solodyn virtually eliminated any acne I had, both on my face and body.  It took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication. I didn't experience any side effects until about four weeks into treatment, at which time I began breaking out in very mild hives.  They were so mild, in fact, that I originally thought they may have been caused by a lotion or cosmetic that had gotten on my skin, or maybe by something I had eaten.  The hives would come and go throughout the day, appearing very sparsely on my face, neck, and/or hands.  A few days passed, and I realized that they must have been caused by the drug, so I stopped taking it and the hives went away after a day or so.  I want to stress that these hives were very mild.  I have had allergic reactions to drugs in the past (which may have made be more susceptible this time) and every previous experience I've had with drug-related hives has been much, much worse and possibly life-threatening if not treated.  Perhaps that would have been the case with these as well if I had continued taking the drug, but they didn't seem to be particularly alarming, just mildly annoying. I took one pill every morning at the same time each day.",high
imitrex,2,"imitrex migraines - I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert! flushing, tingling, prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness and pounding heartbeat. Take 1 tablet by mouth. Max 2 tabs per 24 hours.",Low
xanax,8,"xanax anxiety/depression - I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck. lethargy, loss of appetite. I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.",high
allegra,7,"allegra allergies - Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above. Increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache, nervousness, heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to concentrate, irritability, and the loss of appetite. I had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days, before I felt comfortable in taking it again.  Now I take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies. Treatment details included, at first, a dosage first thing every morning, around 6am. During moderate allergy season, this lasted me until the following morning, but as soon as I got up at 6, symptoms came on full strength.  The Allegra did not take effect for an hour and a half.  So I started waking up at 5 to take it then, so that as I prepared for work I was able to do so without runny eyes, nose, etc.  But during the heavy allergy season (dogwood), I would take one at 5am and one at 6pm.

There were no side effects, but I was careful to only use it when needed and not to use it for more than 1 month at a time.

retin-a-micro,10,"retin-a-micro acne - Skin became smoother, fewer breakouts Dry skin was easily remedied with moisturizer.  My skin is aggravated by sunscreens and that concerns me, but using Clinique moisturizer has assisted with the dryness and I have not experienced any irritation.

azopt,10,"azopt glaucoma - Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work.

It does make my mouth pretty dry, especially first thing in the morning. I also have dry eyes I believe as a result of taking trazodone and it makes it difficult to wear contacts because of the dryness.",high
ambien,9,"ambien insomnia - I had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. I was prescribed Ambien 10mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. On the nights I didn't take the medicine, I woke up all through the night. With the medicine, I slept well and soundly. The only side effect I recall, which was very minor, was a sluggish feeling, only if I didn't sleep for a minimum of 7 hours. This was only on one occassion. Post surgery to my right knee I was in considerable pain, and suffered insomnia because of it. Ambien 10mg was prescribed as needed at bedtime. I took it nightly for the first 3 nights post surgery. On the 4th night, I didn't take it, and woke up all through the night. All in all I took the Ambien a total of 7 out of the first 10 days following the surgery. It helped me to sleep very soundly and the pain didn't interupt my sleep. I had no ill effects from it at all. I still have the remaining 20 tablets that were prescribed one year ago.",high
niaspan,10,"niaspan hyperlipidemia - My total serum cholesterol dropped from 280 to 198, LDL dropped from 225 to 122, HDL increased from 38 to 57. My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches, and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes, urea, or sugar. I experience regular mild flushing, along with mild itching of ears and arms. These effects occur within an hour of dosage, and subside after 20-30 minutes. I do not take aspirin or NSAIDs, nor avoid fatty foods with the medication, as is recommended to reduce the flushing and itching. I observe a strict Atkins Diet, with regular supplements of a good iron-free multivitamin, calcium citrate-malate, fish oil, glucosamine/chondroitin and coenzyme Q-10. Liberal use of Morton Lite Salt provides good potassium supplementation. I also use a psyllium-husk fiber supplement to consume  7g of soluable fiber daily in 3 doses, which by itself had significantly lowered my LDL and total cholesterol prior to commencing Niaspan ER therapy.

Subsequently I felt less urge to snack I experienced mood swings, short temper, thirst. I was constantly thirsty and had mild tension headaches too. Often, I will flare up for no good reason but the outbursts went away swiftly. I also observed that I am quite bloated after food. I took the medication for 3 months, 3 times a week to prevent addiction. The treatment is optional with Mediaxal another weight loss drug which I opted out.

The medicine was supplemented with a low calorie diet and exercise.",high
lyrica,1,"lyrica fibromyalgia - There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it. Irrational thinking, disrupted thought process, Slow reactions while operating a vehicle Prescribe to me by my DO as the newest drug for Fibromyalgia she did not know how the drug worked but wanted to me to try it to see if it reduced my muscle pain.

The burning subsided in the second week, but not to the point of being usable on a daily basis. Application of cream nightly 15 minutes after washing.  Product information advised waiting, but it still burned and itched when applying it after waiting.  it had no real visible effect during the time I used it.  I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because I felt a very subjective glimmer of potential improvement at the end of the period, but not enough to overcome the pain.",Low

retin-a-micro,9,"retin-a-micro acne - This cream was very beneficial for the treatment of acne and some blemishes.  I had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  Further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  This cream began to work within several days.  I could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because I applied the cream as soon as I saw a new one forming, many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards. I had no side effects because I was applying the cream correctly; only before bedtime and washed them off in the morning.  However I heard of some other person whp took the same cream but was not aware of those instruction and instead applied it in the morning and  had her face exposed during the day.  The cream worked somewhat for her but the spots where she applied them stayed irritated and would turn red when the wind blew in her face.  This condition remained for several years afterwards for her.  THIS CREAM CANNOT BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN! Otherwise it works beautifully. The treatment was very simple.  At night (and only at night!) I cleaned my face with a mild cleanser or atleast with water and did not apply any other medication before hand.  Afterwards I simply dabbed a very small, thin layer of the cream over the pimple and allowed the cream to dry and then went to sleep.  In the morning I made sure to wash off the cream before going outside.  For very sensitive skin the area may turn red but this is temporary and simply means that instead of applying each day one must use it every other day.",high

I've been on seasonique for three months now and they've been absolutely miserable. For starters, I'm 19 and NEVER have break outs. As soon as I started this pill, I began breaking out every few days. This pill has made me gain about ten pounds. I've been spotting for a month and a half. I have horrible cramps everyday.

I did not experience any side effects that I am aware of.  Of course, I am concered over having high blood pressure which has to be directly related to work-related stress. Apparently, this will be long-term treatment.  My doctor and I had several conversations over high blood pressure.  Though I have increased my exercise routines, there is not a positive impact on my blood pressure.  After 1 month on Norvasc, my blood pressure was within the normal range.",high
wellbutrin,10,"wellbutrin depression; intrusive suicidal impulses - Within a couple of weeks, intrusive thoughts of suicide abated.  Over the next few weeks mood lifted some.  At the time I started I was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  Didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  And I'm against anti-depressants as 1st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. Mood disorders. Does have light stimulant effect which is great for the extreme fatige of depression But/And any activating chemical can also increase hostile, angry feelings so tweek the dose for you so you don't get over reactive with others.

wellbutrin,10,"wellbutrin depression - Wellbutrin and Prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are. None. I'm not sure I understand the question. This was pretty simple - I had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. The drugs prevented that without side effects.",high
remeron,10,"remeron insomnia - Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun. No side effects. No hangover. No morning drowsiness. Take about 1/2 hour before bedtime.",high
avita,9,avita acne - A considerable decline in the occurrence of new spots accompanied treatment. The acne has been practically eliminated if a good cleansing routine is maintained. Red marks have faded. Blackheads have cleared up. The overall result is clearer and smoother skin. Occasional mild skin irritation particularly in the beginning of treatment. Applied a small amount to the face once daily in the afternoon. Applied sunscreen during the day to compensated for the increase in photosensitivity,high
accutane,7,"accutane acne - Eventual Acne reduction. Dry skin and eyes, flaking skin and bloody noses. However, the most pertinent side effect was depression.

sulindac,4,"sulindac baker's cysts behind both knees - After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding. Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period. Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs.",Low

adderall,8,"adderall depression, ptsd fatigue - Definitely noticed right away that I had more energy, better concentration and motivation, and could actually focus for the first time in years. By taking this med, it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: I started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. Now the med simply acts as a support for me, but I am ready to start tapering down my dose!!! Had trouble losing too much weight at first. But that levels off after a while. Had problems sleeping when the dose was increased too quickly. I have to make sure I take the full amount for the day at least before 12 noon or I will have trouble sleeping that night.

I never used more then a pea size per the insturctions but the itching, dryness and rash never went away. It was very difficult to wear an type of makeup that didnt irritate my skin, while using this product.

Weight loss, decreased appetite. If take too late in the day, may affect ability to sleep. Take 1 pill in the morning to treat ADD-like symptoms that started after a car accident. Took several years to get Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia diagnosis and quite awhile after that before this medicine was prescribed. Tried most of the standard ADD medications to help with brain fog but bad side effects, worked for awhile then stopped, or no effect.

It did dry my skin out and there was peeling in some places, like the sides of my nose.  I had to be very careful about not getting it any where around my lips, because if I did I would quickly get a fever blister on my mouth. I don't know why this happened, but it was bothersome.

lexapro,8,"lexapro depression - The benefits were that once I started taking it, I became less emotional when I got upset.  I could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental. If I missed taking a dose, I would feel a bit lightheaded, dizzy or have a headache.  Too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood. After a break-up, I was very depressed and upset all the time.  I began taking a dose of 20mg and within a few days, noticed a difference.  I had fewer dramatic mood swings, and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  I did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication, and I feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  I continue to take this medication because I have been told I have a natural chemical imbalance, and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  Overall, I feel I benefit from taking it, and unless I miss a dose, I have no side effects.",high

I did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, I felt worse. I couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  It sometimes made me agitated too. I really wasn't comfortable with taking Prozac in the first place - I had a crappy HMO doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  I really just needed a change in my life (job, living in DC) to reverse my depression.  In other words, I think my depression was situational, not a chemical imbalance.

In the period of winding down the Citalopram dose then the 7 weeks on Mirtazapine I went from mildly depressed / just about coping to suicidal, unable to cope and deeply depressed most of the time.

Now, when I raise my eyebrows, my eyebrows go up and the middle of my forehead stays still.  It looks a bit strange. I had 300 units of Dysport injected into my forehead in about 5 different places. I was told to not bend over or lie back for a few hours or touch my forehead after the treatment.  I followed my doctors instructions.

I subsequently discovered that these are all too common ""rare"" side effects, among many others, and none of them emerged until a few days after finishing the dose.   Unless you have no other options, this is a medication to be avoided. I subsequently discovered that I was prescribed this drug for a condition that any number of other drugs would have cleared up just as as easily and was given way too much of it as well.  The whole experience has been a nightmare.  Nearly a year later, still suffering after-effects.  Do not take this drug without checking it out.

When taken continuously for 3-5 months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  We then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone. Spironolactone caused occasional leg cramping.  The Lo-ovral caused some water retention. Spironolactone was taken 50 mg a day and then increased after 3 months to 100 mg twice a day.

And, to this day, I am not pregnant :)  The benefits of this ""pill"" were far greater than any others I have tried, and I have tried several different brands. The treatment side effects were minimal.  In fact I can't think of any.  I have tried many different types of the pill where it had side effects on my face, barely reduced cramps, however this one didn't have any of those side effects and I continue to use it. it was one pill a day, as any birth control pill is usually taken.

Started using Cymbalta 60mg to primarily for chronic tension headaches and neck/back pain and the resulting depression from chronic pain.  Worked wonderfully for about three months then slowly lost effectiveness.  Tried increasing to 90mg with little response.  Ended up switching antidepressants and finding different means to treat the pain.

It also helped with pimples and welts that would sometimes come on during a bought of the rosacea. Side effects were it caused my skin to become extremely dried out. Used more moisturizer which did not seem to help. I also became very sensitive to the sun which was a problem because even if i used sunscreen I would become blotchy looking. The Dr. had me take one 100mg pill 2 x a day. Said I would need to use for an indefinite amount of time. After 5 months I went off of them because I couldn't be outside much.,high

I had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  I also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  I had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired, and I also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  The  Concerta really helped me control all of those things. Some of the side affects that I had were:  my stomach would hurt sometimes and other times it was difficult to eat without getting queezy.  I didn't have much of an appetite.  When the medicine wore off, it seemed to have a strong rebound effect and things became difficult for me during that last several hours of my day. I liked taking the medication, I just wish it would have lasted longer during the day.  By 3p-5pm it had wore off and that seemed to by my busiest time of day with the kids, dinner and house stuff all at once. The treatment details were pretty basic.  I just took the medication in the morning at the same time of day every day.  I was allowed to skip it on the weekends or less busy times if I so desired.

Slight loss of libido, erections affected very, very slightly (takes a small amount more time to achieve full). Started years ago when I saw hair falling out slowly. Worked extremely well, but saw more negative reviews over the years and felt more sluggish (in my mind) over time. Decided its not worth it, and am off it cold turkey as of 4 days ago.

After hearing about possible side effects on the News I stopped taking Singular, whiched ended the severe depression. In the begining Singulair seem to work well controlling my allergies, however I slowly developed strong depression side effects. I've never had problems with depression before.

I tried them all but had terrible side effects. My doctor is extremely good with medication therapy for depression and anxiety and decided I have a serotonin sensitivity and so put me on this drug which works on a different endorphin pathway called gabba.

valtrex,8,"valtrex genital herpes - The sores became much less painful very soon, on the 2nd day. Overall, the healing was much faster, and there were only two pills a day to take (not 2 x 3 times a day, like with old-times Acyclovir), which was convenient As I have a chronic gastritis, my stomach rarely agrees with oral treatments, so I felt minor irritation, a bit of heartburn, but nothing serious I had had herpes for years before I was prescribed Valtrex (previous treatments were Acyclovir). It was prescribed on the second day after the sores appeared and I noticed the improvement the next day - the pain was almost gone. I took two pills per day, one in the morning and one in the evening, for 7 days, after which the remission was longer than the previous ones (sometimes, the outbreaks happened as often as every two weeks), about two months. 
After that, I started taking 2 pills of Valtrex the day I started feeling the outbreak (a nasty, gnawing feeling in the area where the sores would appear) and if it does not prevent the outbreak entirely, it lasts much shorter, is much less painful, and each time the remissions are rather long.",high
xyrem,9,"xyrem narcolepsy, fibromyalgia - Woke up feeling a little less like a zombie, No more insomia. Out of sorts, falling if I get up when medication has taken affect. I take this medication for severe narcolepsy. It has helped with the feeling of not sleeping at all when I would wake up the next morning. However, if you do not get into bed and STAY for about 3 hours you can fall and do things you don't even realize you are doing. I got up to use the bathroom a few times on this medication and once I fell into the bathtub and also have fallen asleep on toilet if I have gotten up to use the bathroom. It can take affect VERY quickly if you have an empty stomach. There was a time I thought I had at least 15 minutes before it put me to sleep but I hadn't eaten much and it kicked in in 5 minutes. I fell asleep talking to my Fiance. It literally knocks you out like when you are put under anesthesia for surgery. It can be very dangerous but it is quite affective for helping you sleep and go into the refreshing cycles of sleep.",high

I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done, I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later, at which time I had to discontinue, but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life. I experienced a loss of libido and inability to climax. 
Loss of appetite (a GOOD side affect in my books! I lost quite a few kgs and it did wonders for my self esteem). 

I would NOT recommend taking this with alcohol, especially something like tequila which is an upper.

They gave me an injection of 50 miligrams and in about 15 minutes I was pain free and feeling normal. Sometimes a little queasiness if taken on an empty stomach.  Sometimes a little fatigue and a feeling of slight slowness. My insurance only covers 9 pills every 28 days, so my physician prescribes 100 miligram caplets and I cut them in half to give more dosages.  The caplets work well if the migraine is caught early. I most often wake up with the migraine starting and will take my pill and lie back down with a cold cloth or ice pack for 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how advanced the pain is. 

If I catch it really early the pain stops progressing and I feel well with in 30 minutes to an hour.

Prescribed by my psychiatrist to use in various doses over several years of use to use for anxiety and panic, and in conjunction with Klonopin as an effective measure to reduce a mixed/manic episode of bipolar disorder in an acute situation, and also at a low-level dose every day to reduce the chance of episodes from occuring.

botox,5,"botox for wrinkle (line) reduction - Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details. Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days. The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled.",high
cymbalta,10,"cymbalta chronic back pain/depression/anxiety - Hello all !
Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription. I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant. I am very pleased overall otherwise. 1 pill (30mg) Per day, in the morning.",high
cipro,1,"cipro skin infection - None. The Cipro appeared not to work for my skin infection. Extreme swelling of the lips. I was approximately 44 years old. When fertilizing my garden, the wind kicked up and blew the fertilizer all over me. After washing it off, the skin on my midsection (around the stomach area) began to itch and turn red. Shortly afterwards, blisters appeared and the skin began to be infected. My doctor prescribed Cipro, which not only did not work but caused my lips to be extremely swollen, so swollen that the skin on my lips split in a few places and bled. I could actually easily see my swollen lips by simply casting my eyes downward. I stopped taking the Cipro and reported the condition to my doctor, who was at a loss to explain why the Cipro did not help my skin infection.",Low

seasonique,1,"seasonique have not stop bleeding - None Bleeding not even Spotting Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

Final words...... Good luck if you are on this prescription, and I hope you win, if not, you defintely need these words ""Good Luck""! :)",Low

My mood brightened, I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing, began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate, increased energy, increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return. I actually felt pretty upset during the first couple of weeks - shaky, a little manic and sensitive.  That did go away, though.  I also had occasional insomnia throughout.

Then by the fourth to fifth month, I started to experience heart palpitations at an increasing rate daily. I was weaned off and restarted 6 or so months later and once again, by the 4-5 month range, the palpitations started to increase again.

Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain. Would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins, highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  Have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably. Doctor prescribed lexapro when I had seen him about black moods & depression which is something I have had on and off since I was very young.   Depression was starting to effect my family life so felt I needed to see a doctor, he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  I was prescribed 10mg and take one tablet daily.

My skin on the drug was very sensitive to sunlight but not with the Murad treatment. I did get a yeast infection with the drug and increased sensitivity to sunlight.

keppra,5,"keppra for epilepsy - We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control. The main side effect we noticed with Keppra was weight loss.  She dropped 20 lbs. in less than a month.  She had a very suppressed appetite for the first 6 or 7 months.  She has since gained back maybe 5 lbs. but continues to have a suppressed appetite just not as much as at first. She takes 3 pills in the morning upon waking and 2 pills at night before going to bed.  She was taking 1 Klonopin pill but is now taking Lamictal and is gradually increasing the dosage.

strattera,8,"strattera add - Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof. Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy. With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug.",high

After suffering for 4 or 5 weeks I went to my doctor. He took 1 look at my arms and said I had hives. Probably due to seasonal allergies. He wrote a prescription for Zantac and sent me on my way.

The feeling of loving people was not present , things that should upset you , i would just shrug and go about my business. became apathetic. robotic behavior was noted by others after dealing with postpartum depression for a full year i sought treatment, also the aversion to wanting to go into public or talk to people was present. The therapist put me on paxil since it could help fight bothe conditions at the same time. Cognitive therapy was also applied but not helping. the drug paxil took affect and i was feeling fine for first month and a half, afterwards the decline of emotions was subconsciuosly worrisome (guess you can't kill all anxiety) i knew my apathetic behavior was not healthy and decided too much emotion was better than none.

seroquel,9,"seroquel severe insomnia - Seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams. Seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing. Highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings. Weight gain and some grogginess in the morning. I am no longer a size 10, but I'm okay with it because sleep keeps me sane. I take one 100mg tablet about 2 hours before I go to bed (I have a slow metabolism).  I allow about 30 minutes in the morning to wake up and be functional before I leave for work or school. I usually hit the snooze button about 3 times.",high
ritalin,8,"ritalin adhd - Primarily, my son was much better able to focus, control his impulsivity and, as a result, did better in school.  Our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could. Initially, he experienced some sleepiness, but he adjusted to the medication and no longer has this problem. We were initially reluctant to treat an otherwise healthy boy for what some describe as ""boy"" behavior, but he was increasingly frustrated with his inability to get along with siblings and classmates.  However, seeing now how much it has helped him - without making him into a different person -- we're glad we did.",high
lexapro,6,"lexapro depression - less irritability, slept better. Was less hungry. mild mania, manifested by spending more money. I felt less inhibition in my spending and bought more products than I had in the past. Was put on paxil which was quite effective but had the side effect of wt gain. Switched to lexapro. Wt gain more easily controlled, but wasn't as effective as paxil for depression. Now I'm on nothing and I'm doing well.",high

oracea,10,"oracea rosacea - Marked reduction in redness & flushing and complete elimination of pustules.  Ease of use over creams, etc. none 1 pill every morning at least one hour before eating.  Topical medications were a hassle to use consistently, were seldom ""cosmetically elegant"", and did very little to keep symptoms from escalating.  Dermatologist prescribed Oracea when it became obvious the the topicals were never going to control the pustules.  Oracea cleared it up in a couple of weeks and gave consistent results throughout treatment - Rosacea was practically forgotten about - with no side effects.  Several months after discontinuing use, pustles have returned but are nothing like before treatment and are manageable with OTC topicals.  Expensive but Oracea does offer discounts worth looking into.",high
lexapro,6,"lexapro depression - The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases. On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal. The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.",high
retin-a,9,"retin-a acne - My acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to Retin-A!  It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began. Peeling, dryness, sun sensitivity I applied a small amount of Retin-A every evening before bed and washed if off in the morning.  If you are able to get through the initial stage which includes the side effects  (peeling, dry skin, redness, irritation, and sun sensitivity) your skin will emerge better looking and healthier in the end.",high
cipro,10,"cipro serious food poisoning, uti - I landed in a West African hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. I vomited for 12 hours until I got the drip and then I was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).

Cipro is also the god of beating Urinary tract infections: I've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly. I had no side effects. For UTI, take one every 12 hours for prescribed number of days. (And finish the whole course!)",high
celebrex,3,"celebrex knee pain - I did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  I chose to discontinue the treatment. Some mild stomach irritation. The knee pain became progressively more severe over the course of 2-3 months. My family doctor sent me to physical therapist who stress tested the knee, and the physical therapist determined that I should see the specialist.  A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible, thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage, without any noticable relief, I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain. Next I self applied sparingly over time some physical therapy at the local gym, to strengthen any possible sprain-injury situation that may have occurred. To date my knees have been relatively trouble free when i adhere to age appropriate work and leisure pursuits (reducing strenuous projects as i get older). My construction business is slowest in late fall and winter, during which i continue my physical activity at a local gym.  Thus avoiding future injuries.",Low
minocycline,10,"minocycline acne - Treatment cleared the complexion from acne breakout and eliminated the redness/residual under the skin.  This drug had an almost immediate effect on the facial and back areas of the patient.  If the patient stopped taking the minocycline, the acne almost immediately returned.  It kept the bacteria at bay while on the medication. There were no adverse side effects.  The medication stated to take with food, but on those occasions that food wasn't taken, there was no stomach upset or other adverse effects. Take 1 tablet by mouth 2x day or after 6 weeks, reduce dosage to 1xday.  Patient required the 2xdaily dosage for the duration to keep the acne manageable.  When tried to go to a lesser dosage, the acne breakouts returned.",high
lunesta,3,"lunesta insomnia - Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it). After taking it before bed, anything you drink or eat will taste metallic-like and that includes bottled water. Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally, I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated, depressed, and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night, you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up, you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem. All in all, not any fun. I'm still taking Lunesta but that's only because I am supposed to see my doctor this week to discuss modifications and adjustments.",Low
soma,1,"soma migraines/upper back pain - None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep. It wasn't long until I became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market. There aren't any treatment details.  The pain management physician prescribed the medication each monthly visit and increased the dosage not long after introducing the drug as treatment.  These kinds of physicians are really drug dealers cloaked in an DEA approved office.",Low
effexor,8,"effexor depression - I did not experience the ""brain-fog"" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely. I was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking Effexor. Thankfully, this side-effect abated after two weeks. I've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from 20/20 to maybe 20/30-40. After using Celexa for 7 years, it decreased in its helpfulness. Celexa always made me feel like I was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. Immediately after taking Effexor, I felt the fog lift and I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am,  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. I still have moments where I feel a little anxious, but as a whole, the depression is being taken care of. When I noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye, I stopped taking the drug. My eyesight seemed to return to normal. Oddly, my left eye is fine, but it was always extraordinarily good.",high
lithium-carbonate,8,"lithium-carbonate bipolar disorder ii - Mood more level. My speech is slower, not as pressured. I tend to listen better. I feel more ""chill"", though I still do experience free floating anxiety. My mood is significantly improved, but the anxiety, while lower, is the most stubborn of the symptoms. Thirst, tremor, slight weight gain, occassional nausea I have been taking the medication for a year. I had started at 900 mg daily, but found that while I was improved, there was still room for improvement, so the dose was increased to 1200 mg/d. Of all the medications I have taken for bipolar disorder, this has been the most effective; and the cheapest too lol!!",high
metoclopramide,1,"metoclopramide nausea - There were no treatment benefits from this particular drug.   My nausea was not controlled at all, in fact I felt more nauseaus after taking the medication. I had severe restlessness, developed an intense feeling of anxiety, had an extreme desire to sit down, then lay down and went on to develop a dystonic reaction.   I developed an intense feeling of doom, my stomach had feelings of cramps, knotting and pain.  My neck felt tense and the ambulance was called and I was taken to the emergency dept of local hospital. Ambulance officers gave me pain relief and this settled my stomach of the knotting and cramping/pain.  This also settled the feeling of doom.   In emergency, after numerous examinations and questionning, abdo xray, I was given IV hydration x 2 litres and Ondansetron IV x 2 - 8 hours apart.  I was observed in emergency overnight and went home the next morning with no side effects at all.   Never will I take maxalon again!",Low

One hip was stable and one had lower bone density none I took the fosamax with 8 oz. of water and walked around for an hour.The first couple of years I did not take calcium supplements.  Then I did.  Since I do not think the results were really an improvemrnt, Now I am taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D and magnesium and a fairly new drug called foseum which is suppose to be entirely natural like an herb, but more expensive than fosamax that must be taken twice a day.",Low
spironolactone,10,"spironolactone acne - The benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. I used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. I did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. However, I still breakout. Not with cysts but smaller pimples. They seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. I have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. Spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. My face is also less oily. The only side effects were temporary breast discomfort. I swear they got bigger. That however did subside and I no longer have that discomfort. The other side effect is frequent urination. If I drink a lot of water during the day I have to go all the time but even if I don't I still have to when I drink water or whatever. It's a little annoying but the pros far out weigh the cons. I simply take one 100 mg pill a day after I have eaten and drink plenty of water. I usually take it in the morning. I use spironolactone in conjuntion with Ziana topical cream. This combination has really helped to basically rid me of acne. Thank goodness, since I am almost 27 years old and it is embarrassing to still get acne. I love this stuff!",high
wellbutrin-xl,6,wellbutrin-xl low energy and depression - I became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. I was a better mother and wife. I could focus and was not lethargic or sad. The side effects mostly were related to low sex drive. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and then depression. I was treated first for the hypothyroidism and then the depression. The Zoloft worked but I still felt like I had a lower than normal energy level.

My doctor has prescribed one tablet daily as an ongoing treatment.",high
tirosint,4,"tirosint mild hypothyroidism - TSH numbers brought down to normal levels, seemed to improve constipation, dry skin and cold intolerance Increased fatigue and sleepiness were the worst side effects.  On the 75 MCG dose, which put me into Hyperthyroidism according to TSH numbers, I fell asleep in public twice.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I could not get up in the mornings, was tired all the time and had brain fog.  I think I could've slept 24/7.  Very frustrating.  Also had weight gain. Began at 75 MCG and they lowered my dose to 50 MCG and the fatigue/sleepy/brain fog symptoms got better (I did not fall asleep in public again) but I was still more tired and foggy than I was before I began taking the medication.  I took the medication in textbook form--first thing in the morning and did not eat for 4 hours.  Finally, the doctor gave me permission to stop taking because I was afraid the physical symptoms were going to negatively impact my job.  Had my blood checked last week after one month off the medication and numbers showed I was back in hypothyroidism.  Doctor is mystified at my symptoms, which for the most part seem to be the opposite of what they should have been on the medication.  He prescribed me Armour today and I am scheduled to go back in 6 weeks to have my blood checked.  I am a healthy, 36 year old female.  I exercise regularly and attempt a healthy diet.

This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable. I experienced minimal side effects. Initially while titrated the appropriate dosage and timing of the medication, I experienced some episodes of hypoglycemia. However, once my dosage was adjusted I no longer had episdoes of hypoglycemia. I did experience some gastric upset with this medication in the first thirty days. I had issues of cramping, gas and upset stomach after taking the medication. However after thirty days my body had gotten accustom to the medication and I no longer have any gastric side effects. My diabetes treatment is three fold. I take medication ( glucophage, gliperide, & actos) follow a diabetes friendly diet and exercise regularly. My medications are glucophage 1000mg in the morning and 1500mg at night; actos 45 mg in the morning and gliperide 20 mg in the morning.

lexapro,8,"lexapro anxiety and depression - After the first few DAYS my anxiety was greatly reduced. I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression. At first I had some mild nausea, which went away and then I didn't have any side effects. This medication did not make me gain weight and it did not lower my sex drive- both which were concerns for me. The medication worked great, and I would have rated it a 10 except getting OFF the medication was difficult. For six-eight weeks I had what I've come to learn are called brain zaps... a strange sensation that is difficult to describe and not pleasant. Lucky for me I had read about this so it did not scare me... otherwise I would have been very concerned. I pretty much just rode it out for those 6-8 weeks and then it went away and I've been fine. If I had to do it over I would still have chosen to take the lexapro because is was so effective for my anxiey/depression which was off the charts when I started.",high

propecia,10,"propecia hair loss - My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on. While they are forced to tell you that there is something like a 5% chance of becoming temporarily impotent, even for the people that effects the literature says that the majority of that small number get back their sex drive while continuing to take the drug. If you stop taking the drug it comes back immediately. I've not experienced any lessening of my libido, nor has anyone else that I've recommended the drug to. You have to have a doctor's prescription, but to avoid the annoyance and price of a doctor's visit you can go to several websites that allow you to pay an extra fee, fill out a questionaire and then have a doctor who is on their payroll give you the prescription. That is okay because really if you're having hair loss and you know you are, why do you need a dermatolagist to tell you- ""yeah, you're losing your hair""? It's an idiotic rule that makes this a controlled drug.  Anyway you take one pill a day- that's it, with or without meals.",high

As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail. There were no adverse side effects.  By taking the medication and ensuring that the wound was kept clean, infection was kept at bay. I was prescribed Augmentin at 875mg to be taken twice a day for 10 days in order to fend off infection in my nail bed.  Meanwhile,I used topical iodine and hydrogen peroxide to clean the wound several times a day and applied new bandages at each cleaning.

I kept applying it diligently as prescribed. In c couple of days there was a rash on the area  ( I called the doctor about it and she said to stop using it for a couple of days and then apply it , since that might have a been a  normal side effect). I did what she told me to, so I reapplied the drug again in a couple of days, there was redness and irritation and then later on the following day I had a cold sore developing on the spot (the affected area where I was applying the cream was the upper lip and the noso-labial folds). Plus to everything else I had a bad a headache, which as I found later could have been the side effect of that medication. I went to another dermatologist and she said that she would have never prescribed that medication for the face especially if I have a tendency to develop cold sores because that medication serves as a immunosuppressant.",Low

I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too. Side effects for me include: Heaviness in my limbs, muscle aches, tight feeling in head, flushing, increased heart rate, drowsiness. Take 100 mg at first indication of migraine.

A thin coating of the nail gel was applied to the entire nail and underneath the nail wherever possible twice a day.  The nails were filed down with an emery board on a weekly basis to scratch up the surface to better allow the nail gel to penetrate.  The underneath of the nails were scraped clean as much as possible on a daily basis.  By the end of the first month ingrown toenail pain was gone.  By the end of the second month, all toenails were noticably less yellow.

axert,10,"axert migraine - This ia a life altering medication for me.  I get occaisional migraines due to hormonal changes, allergy and weather changes.  This medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  It works within about an hour.  It stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  I am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug. I rarely experience any side effect from this medication.  Occaisionaly I may feel a little drowsy or relaxed but it is very mild and even welcome at times. I take this medication at the onset of a migraine or severe headache.  It works 99% of the time.  Rarely I have to take a second dose (as instructed) if the headache does not subside but this is very rare.  It was prescribed for menstrual migraine but works for other causes of headache as well.",high
prozac,8,"prozac depression with anxiety - Within 3 weeks I noticed a ""lifting "" of mood and a general sense of being more energized and interested in everyday activities. I was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again. The drug was somewhat over stimulating leading to mild feelings of panic. If not taken with food it caused stomach burning. It dramatically exacerbated my insomnia and suppressed my appetite and libido. The dose was prescribed in capsule form at 20 mg to be taken daily, preferably in the morning.",high
propecia,6,"propecia hairloss - The benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). I noticed that less hairs in the M shape were falling out. It also regrew some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. I also noticed that thin, weak hairs regrew stronger and thicker. Side effect were a feeling of tiredness and lowered libido. These side effects passed away after my body adapted to the lower DHT levels in the body. Propecia is a medication that is used to treat prostate cancer. It does inhibit DHT(dihydrotestosterone)that is the most potent form of testosterone. It also raises testosterone levels by 10%.

Propecia is also a treatment for male pattern baldness. DHT is known to bind to the receptor on the hair follicle. By doing this the hair will eventually die for those with genetic mpb. By using Propecia the DHT levels will be lowered, and you hair will not be affected as much as if you did not use propecia.

For hairloss Propecia should be taken as 1mg pr day.",high

While it did somewhat control my partial seizures, I was sick ALL THE TIME and had such severe headaches it sucked!
That was 8 yrs ago for about a year. 

This time around we decided to try it again with the Dilantin/Topamax combo to get rid of the partial seizures as the generalized seizures were licked. Smarter doctor got me on 150mg am/150mg pm for a total of 300mg a day. I'm doing well this time with rare bouts of nausea, a little increased acne during titration, some headache during titration, some sleepiness but no other side effects.

My doctor said to keep taking the medication, but I don't think his brain was working.  Dry heaves means you have vomited up your bile and NOTHING is staying down and you are still heaving nothing.

seroquel,8,"seroquel bipolar i - The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning. There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out. I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel, Paxil and lithium works best together for me.",high

The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex. I usually feel really tired and depressed the next day after haven taken Imitrex. I feel the drug depresses all systems. It takes off the edge of the pain, but still leaves a dull feeling in the head. I take an imitrex within an hour of onset of a migraine headache. However, I do not take more than one Imitrex per day.

The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself. The side effects began with nausea and stomach pains mirroring acid reflux which even Nexium could not relieve. Then difficulty breathing and irregular heartbeat, extreme fatigue and body aches, finally vomiting matter resembling coffee grounds - really scary!

I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles. I did not experience any burning sensations with this product in the first week or there after. The product did make my face peel significantly the following day and this occured even with the use of an exfoliating facial wash each morning. I applied the product to my face in the morning OR evening and did it in combination with other typical facial sunscreen products and mosterizers.

In the forth day it was 1.5 kg heigher. In the following four days it returned to almost normal.  During this period I felt tired and dizzy and fainted at one occasion. The blood test indicated that the concentrations of potassium and sodium were outside the normal limits (Potassium too high, 5.3 mmol/L and sodium too low, 134 mmol/L), in a dangerous range. Similarly to the pH, the safe range for these two ions is narrow. Four days later the potassium was OK, 5.1 mmol/L albeit high, but the sodium, remained unchanged.

Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic. For the initial two weeks, where I applied Renova caused a stinging sensation and a mild redness.  My eyes were watery for a few weeks as well.  Also, for that initial few weeks, the skin looked dry and the wrinkles looked worsened in that one-hour ""drug-work"" duration for which I didn't put on any moisturizer.  All the symptoms are gone now, and the skin is denser and firmer and I no longer fear people looking at my wrinkles anymore. I asked the doctor to prescribe Renova to me.",high

wellbutrin,5,"wellbutrin depression - I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water. None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  I haven't felt much difference. Once a month I see a psychiatrist, although I am ""in between"" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  I have been without a therapist for a while now, wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.

norvasc,1,"norvasc high blood pressure - Lowered his blood pressure with one pill to the point of passing out, and having severe cramping. One does dropped his blood pressure so low that it was necessary to have him hospitalized for kidney malfunction. It caused severe cramping of the intestines due to lack of blood flow. At admittance to the ER, he was put on IV to increase the blood preassure. The doctors did not believe that the Norvasc could have a severe effect because the Lisinopril, which ordinarily is the medication that causes severe reactions, did not effect his blood pressure. The one Norvasc pill caused his blood pressure to go from 185/109 to 64/43. It is important for all doctors to realize that while drug testing can give you the general reaction of most people; it is imperative to be conscious that some patients will react in a completely unexpected way. This is a situation where the man's experience with opposite reactions to caffeine, and other ""uppers"" to the norm would have given some indication that his reactions to medications can be contra-indicated. Post emergency, the doctors felt that the reaction had to be caused by something else other than the Norvasc.

celexa,10,"celexa stress, feeling overwhelmed - Most say it takes 6 weeks for this drug to really be in your system. After taking for 3 days I could feel the effects, I was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back. I have gained weight. Whether it was due to celexa or turning 40, I am not sure. Irregardless, the benefits have far outweighed the weight gain, if it was due to the Celexa Initially started at 20 mg., worked great. During an exstremely stressful time where increased to 40 mg. I will be reducing down to 20mg very soon.",high

provigil,7,"provigil bipolar disorder with severe lows & fatigue, - I do feel much more awake, but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me. Acne!!!!!!!!!! ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it, but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks, but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil, but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss. My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie.",high
levoxyl,9,"levoxyl hypothyroid - My hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  Now it is growing back and getting thicker.  Before I was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  Now I am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer. After I take it in the morning I feel nauseous unless I eat something when I take it.  It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, so sometimes I do this, but feel queasy for an hour or so. This is something that I will probably continue to take.  Even though it makes me a bit nauseous, the benefits greatl outweigh the risks for me.  It is so nice to be able to be warm again, and for my hair to be growing back.",high
tramadol,9,"tramadol 2 compressed discs in neck - Completely eliminated neck pain. Interestingly, did not reduce slight-to-moderate left hip pain (see article on pain in 11/09 issue of Scientific American) Slight euphoria, slight tiredness, but cannot sleep. I've had 2 compressed discs in neck for over 5 years. Had taken Hydrocodone plus Tylenol for a few months, but it had nasty side-effects (I don't know how Dr. House does it).

I have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)! I had a very bad headache for about a week, but it's ok now.  I had a sinus infection last week, and I thought it was from it being springtime, but then I read that sinus infections could be a side effect.  I felt pretty awful last week and wanted to sleep a lot.  I am still not sure if it was just allergies or not. I feel sorry for the women who have had negative side effects with the Nuvaring.  So far so good, so I am sticking to it!!",high

I went to doc, they gave me a sample of Prilosec. I began on it and developed the problems. I stopped taking it for about two days, I started feeling bleh and the symptoms Prilosec caused started to go away. To make sure it was the Prilosec, I took it again. The side affects returned within a hour. I am now struggling to get rid of the symptoms and the withdrawal. I would not recommend Prilosec to anyone.",Low
nexium,9,"nexium gerd with laryngeal spasms - almost complete elimination of gerd symptoms--reflux,heartburn,nausea,choking spasms, cough.  I have also been able to eat a wider variety of foods without discomfort. Little to no side effects.  Occasional stomach discomfort,gas, diarrhea, but these could also be associated with irritable bowel syndrome.  All in all, very few problems with this medication compared to its benefits. Previously took Losec, but continued to have problems with choking spasms, which became increasingly distressing.  The doctor prescribed Nexium at a lower dose, 30 mg., which helped but did not eliminate symptoms.  Increased to 40, and have been happy with this dose ever since.  The doctor tried reducing it once, but I had a choking spasm within two weeks, so we increased it again.  She was a little concerned about risk of osteoporosis, but bone density tests have been normal.",high
synthroid,10,"synthroid fatique, depression - Increase in energy, immediate weight loss. None noticable. I had long complained of fatigue, listlessness, disinterest.  I exhibited classic symptoms of hypo-thyroid, but did not check out as such in the standard blood test.  A new doctor understands that not every person will fall within ""standard"" test results.  God bless her.  The results were rapid and positive with an increase in energy, loss of about 10 pounds of excess weight.",high

For years I cried everyday, freaked out at the drop of a hat, yelled all the time, had no self esteem and sometimes thought I could not go on. After two weeks of taking Lexapro I am a completely different person. I have not cried once after the first week of being treated. I love myself and my kids.

soma,9,"soma back pain - The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain , nearly completlly, and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use. I found that after two to three doses ther seems to be a cumulative affect of the drug on my sense of balance. This is very mild, and only leaves me feeling a bit light headed at times. I am still able to engage in most of my normal neccessary activities around my home. I do refrain from driving or any other possibly risky activity when on this medication. Also , when I have prolonged pain and require several days of medication, I have noticed slight constipation. This is no where near as bad as the constipation caused by vicoden or darvocet. I suffered form damage to soft tissues on my neck and back from an accedent. i crashed on a mountain bike and after the inisial recovery period, I found that certain activited can cause a sharp pain in my back at the base of my neck. This, if not medicated, will grow in the course of a hours, into spasms and tense pain. It will cause me to contort my neck and everything I do brings more pain and discomfort. The medication when taken at the onset of the pain, cause the muscles to relax and the pain to subside in a day. If the pain becomes severe and medication is postponed, it may take several doses of medication over the next day or two to make the muscles relax.",high
metronidazole,3,"metronidazole dog bite prophylaxis - Apparently prevented wound infection, though efficacy of drug is questionable and causality cannot be established. Side effects were severe. Consistent metallic taste in mouth, upset stomach, sleep difficulties, diarrhea, severe dizziness and anxiety. Transient dry mouth. General feeling of being ""spacey"" and unfocused. Took metronidazole to preclude infection after a puncture wound from a dog bite. Did not tolerate medication; ceased therapy after 8 days.",Low
prinivil,10,"prinivil nocturnal myoclonus (like restless leg syndrome) - Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. Lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. Somehow, the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills, neuro transmiter pills and anti-depressants had. No adverse side effects, but it did keep my blood pressure down. Though it is a blood pressure medication, I have never had high blood pressure. I have taken Xanax, Ativan, Clonipin, and many other medications to allow me to sleep, but did not stop the nocturnal myoclonus(similar to restless leg syndrome). This meant I did not remain awake to experience the effects, but my partners did get kicked violently, kept awake with my movements and dirupted sleep. Though it is not known by many doctors, the research was down many years ago on this treatment by a VA doctor while in medical school in the 70s. It has been effective for so many years when I went 15 years without getting acceptable relief.",high
singulair,8,"singulair asthmas/ rhinitis - Singulair appeared to help somewhat with being able to breathe better.
Rhinitis was decreased.  It helped me miss fewer work days, especially when air index quality was poor. During the time I was taking singulair I did not have suicidal thoughts but I did feel VERY depressed VERY often.  I was VERY thirsty while taking singulair.  The drying effect lead to a few nosebleeds, mostly in the mornings. I was instructed by my doctor to take one singulair tablet each evening about one hour before bedtime.",high

I then tried taking 1/2 in the am and 1/2 in the pm to see if that would help, but sadly it didn't.  My husband takes this medication also, and it works beautifully for him.

There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes. It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall. I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.",high

Also after smoking pot it's nice to have a smoke I find. Horrible dreams, not just randomly but every night. I wake up thinking the dreams are real and always have some sort of false emotion towards my boyfriend thinking he did something wrong. Although I know it's a dream I wake up with the feelings and emotions as if it all just happened. Also have had panic attacks in my dreams and woken up having actual panic attacks in real life. Also, I have read up alot about this drug because I like to know what I'm taking and what could happen... no one has said anything about how hungry you get an hour or so after taking it. I normally don't eat in the morning I haven't since I was 12. But after taking this the hunger pains are so extreme I am forced to eat in the morning when taking it. So far so good, I will take crazy dreams every night for all the other benefits.",high

I tested not taking it and the pain almost completely subsided but was scared to completely stop. I did this 2 times. Then he started me on cymbalta.

Combination of tramadol and neurontin in carefully tested comination (to suit patient) brought best pain result to date (injury 26mo prior). Possible dizziness and fatigue, but this is unclear. Both symptoms were present prior to the injury, but were mild, and have worsened with the addition of each of the three medications. Patient also has a secondary depression following the injury, which combined with the injury itself also confound a clear attribution.

xyrem,9,"xyrem fibromyalgia - For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me. I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory. I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up, many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose.",high

Severe bruising on my calves and thighs ( a stated side effect of the drug ), likely yeast overgrowth in abdominal area which lead to bloating, etc.
Graying of the teeth, especially lower teeth, bluish at roots. Lethargy, lack of concentration. My acne/ rosacea began at age 14, and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products, with poor result. I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38, I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers. Been on antibiotics for 24 years, and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. The supplement can be found on CandidaFreedom.

Second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time. not as bad as i was expecting, don't let some little drug mess with your mind man your bigger than that. if any i would say a lower libidio but i kind of like it because before propecia i was wanking off like 10 times a day and now its like once or every other day. propecia is cool just do research, actually this shit is too expensive but if u care about your hair i would recommend it.",high

Other than the initial dry, peeling skin, I had no side affects. I applied the Retin-A to my face every night.  At my dermatologists suggestion, I did not wash my face before applying the cream.

oxycontin,4,"oxycontin post-surgical pain - The pain was definitely reduced, from high discomfort to relatively low discomfort, so long as I wasn't moving. It also helped me to sleep some of the time. During the second and third day, it seemed to increase my post-surgical nausea. Overall, in addition to drowsiness, I experienced a lot of dizziness. I'm not sure whether or not it affected my bowels returning to normal function. At first I was given the oxycodone intravenously, with a button allowing me to choose when I wanted a dose (don't remember the amount) but limited in total amount and frequency (up to every 15 minutes, I think.) Afterwards, I took it in pill form. After several days I decided the side effects were too strong and  got a hydrocodone prescription, which had similar but more mild side effects. In retrospect, I wish that acupunture had been available; when I experienced an auricular 5-needle protocol several weeks later, I found the residual pain I had was immediately reduced, with none of the side effects.",Low

I had a severe allergic reaction in the form of red, extremely itchy, welps all over my body, but concentrated on my ribs, chest, and face.

lexapro,1,"lexapro clinical depression - The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug. This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage. This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable.",Low

metformin,8,"metformin diabetes - the benefit was a lowering of blood sugar and metformin does that very well without leading to hypoglycemia which can happen with some of the other anti-hyperglycemic drugs. Side effects include stomach upset and diarrhea but this usually goes away in about 2-3 weeks. Metformin 500 mg taken twice a day. This controlled by blood sugar but it is important to realize that the medication does not peak until about 4-6 hours after it is taken. This is important knowledge to have in order to time the administration of the drug. When I took it too close to dinner time, it was not as effective as when I took it 4-5 hours before dinner. I wish my healthcare provider or pharmacist had told me when it peaked but that information came from a diabetes educator. I got better control after I knew when to take my dose.",high

I am much more even but am also still on Geodon and kolonpin once a day. I am weaning off of zoloft-am at 50 mg. once a day at moment. I feel the real med that has helped is the Lamictal, I hope to wean off the rest of meds after being stable for a length of time. I do not think I have or had any side affects. It is hard to tell because I am on more than one drug, and while in the hospital I was on others. I am also alcholic so like that Lamictal is not habit forming. I am afraid I will put on weight as others have reported. Diagnosed with Bi-polar 2 WITH MIXED EPISODES AND RAPID CYCLING. Had been perscribed many SSRI'S, due to depression but never fully treated for bi-polar because I felt like I deserved and did not want to give up the few highs I had when not depressed. I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient, because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic, it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago, and have since stopped drinking, which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol, and with out it I was more unstable and manic.

If the stinging sensation does not subside it is preferable to use it every other night instead of every night. I used this every night after cleansing my face.

And it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. I have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. I would pull this drug from the market. Irrational Rage. It has nothing to do with my mental state but the fact that the drug does this to everyone. You have to let it build up in your system because your body is trying to reject a poison. You become addicted. No different than cocaine or speed freaks. It is such a lie. Once a day. I was drooling as I slept. When I could sleep. I was edgy all the time. I was in a brain fog. And nobody knew that I wasn't crazy. This damn drug was making me crazy. I told my stupid shrink that I needed to be calmer and he gave me speed. I told him I was getting irrationally upset and he doubled the dose.

My depression is better over the years but I have less desire for sex.  I have found it tremendously difficult to maintain or loose weight.  The weight problem seems to have increased over the years to a point where I would like to try and stop or at least decrease the medication.  The problem is that when I wanted to have a 3rd child, I decided to discontinue the medication and the effects of stopping Effexor were horrible.  I have seen problems when I miss a dosage so I am scared to try and stop the medicine.  Before I when I ""weaned"" off the medication I had severe headaches, nausea, and dizziness.

A side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my Rosacea symptoms.

I experience slight sedation after taking Catapres which is helpful for me as a light sleeper. I believe I experience some slight lethargy that is ongoing, but not troublesome. When I first started taking Catapres I got a very dry mouth, but this quickly went away. I have experienced no other side effects that I am aware of. I'm not sure what this question means, and may have already answered it. I am taking Catapres and Betaloc for longstanding essential hypertension.

I finally started taking a 1/2 dose.  I had dry eyes, constipation, mouth breathing.   I would drink too much beer if I started drinking because I was so thirsty. Dry skin became an irritating problem.  This problem has improved since I changed medications. The drug was very helpful at first.  It improved my concentration, my ability to focus and pay attention increased and I slept better.  As the years passed, I became aware that I was in a state of semi-dehydration much of the time.  This did not dawn on me until I had taken the drug for over seven years.  I started to keep water at my desk and drank a quart and a half on average every day just during the day at work.  This helped considerably, but the dry skin and constipation finally lead to my asking the doctor for a change.  I am curious if there is any connection between the dehydration and potential dementia.",high

drug to treat/minimize the migraine symptoms.  With the option of taking 1/2, I could start at this lower dose and try to take it as soon as it was clear a migraine was setting in.

fosamax-plus-d,10,"fosamax-plus-d osteoporosis - Between 1998 and 2006, when I was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. After I received my bone density results in 2006, my physician put me on Fosamax, which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008, my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period. I remain in the range of osteopenia, but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my T-scores. I have experienced no adverse side effects at all while taking this medication. I take a pill in the morning when I get up, once a week, on the same day each week.  I take it with an 8 ounce glass of water and do not lay down, eat, or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. I also take calcium/d vitamin supplements daily, eat plenty of dairy products, walk at least 3 times a week, and avoid alcohol and soft drinks.  I was already following these dietary habits when my previous bone density tests were done.  Because of that, I credit fosamax with the improvement  that has taken place.",high
effexor,9,"effexor depression - Signifigantly reduced depression, social anxiety. Mild side effects. Forgetfullness, some manifestation of laissez-faire attitude (not caring as much about work issues, but in some ways this is a good thing! As long as you don't end up slacking off too much), harder to reach orgasm (but much better than Paxil or Prozac in this matter). I've been on Effexor for about 7 years, and love it. It doesn't make you sleepy or passive. It doesn't kill your sex drive, though it is reduced a bit, and it's still harder to reach orgasm. Best part about this med is that it doesn't make you sleepy or foggy. 

You may have to increase dosage after a couple of years. It started to poop out on me at about year 3, and since then I've been climbing with the dosage.

In addition, the drug did not suppress the libido on the opposite it increase the sexual desire. Side effects were many.  THEre was a decrease in energy levels and dizzines.  There was weight gain. At the end of the 30 days period the feelings of depression were still an issue The treatment consisted of taking 30mg every morning for thirty days.  Also, started an exercise program to increase the endorphins levels in the brain.  The doctor suggested fifteen minutes of sunshine a day. After the thirty days period the follow up consisted of answering questions about the positive and negative  effects of the drug. After reviewing the answers it was determined that I needed to be on a higher dosage because the symptoms of depression were still an issue.  The increase in dosage was from 30mg to 60mg and still at the end of thirty days there was mo change in the symptoms.  Finally I had to switch to another medication which so far it has worked fine.",Low

meridia,10,"meridia overeating, weight gain - I lost 90 pounds in 6 months. The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose! Insomnia sometimes. My bedtime(before Meridia) was around 10pm but once I began taking the medicine, I couldn't sleep sometimes until 12am or 1am, but even with lack of sleep, I never felt fatigued like I thought I would. Every once in a while, mild headaches & dry mouth. But nothing too major or life-threatening. Lost 91 lbs. in 6-7 months. Kept the weight off even to this day (4 years later) b/c the Meridia taught me the key to weight loss: Less calorie intake. And since the Meridia trained my body to get full quicker, I was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication.",high
prozac,9,"prozac depression - Reduced depression and feelings of hopelessness within 3 weeks. I like being able to increase dosage when things get a little rough and then back off to the original dosage when things settle down. Extreme sleepiness, feeling ""out of it"".  It was really hard to work and be on this medication.  I wanted to give it up as I literally could not stay awake but I made it though the first 6 weeks and things were better after that.

Sometimes the stomach pain was so painful it was worse then an actual flare-up. I stopped taking Asacol because of the intense stomach pain it caused me as well as the nausea.

synthroid,8,"synthroid hypothyroidism - The synthetic thyroid hormone treatment made it so I was at least able to function, sped my metabolism up enough to keep warm and have regular menses. Side effects come from taking either too little or too much Synthroid. It is a tightrope balancing act and the blood work is not specific enough to guide the clinical course. Compared to others who naturally have a functioning thyroid, it is clear to see that Synthroid is an inferior product to what the thyroid makes naturally in a healthy individual. I know that I still have minor hypothyroid symptoms even when my blood counts show that I have therapeutic levels of the medication. Additionally, generic versions of Synthroid seem to be even less effective at relieving all the symptoms, even though the blood counts could be normal. With hypothyroidism becoming a very common condition these days, one would think that new medications would be coming out, but the medical professionals seem content to stick with Synthroid because ""on paper"" it seems to be safe and effective.",high

I wanted to switch from Atenolol because of concerns it would increase insulin resistance. So my Dr. prescribed Lisinopril and told me to take it for 3 weeks to see if it was going to be effective. After 3 weeks it was effective but I started noticing that gradually when I laid down to sleep at night, it felt like there was lots of mucous in my throat. Then the tickle started in my throat which made me feel like gagging. Then my voice was affected. It became hoarse and I noticed my throat felt soar.

This went away after a few weeks. 1mg tablet twice daily.,high
tazorac,9,"tazorac acne, photoaging - This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging. Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated. The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream. There is a generic version available from an Indian manufacturer called Glenmark. Their product is called Tazret. It is virtually the same as the original.",high
botox,10,"botox migraines - I used to have near-daily migraines.  I tried every migraine medication on the market.  Either they didn't have any effect, or I was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, I am virtually migraine-free for months. Sometimes I had some minor swelling at an injection site.  It went away within days. My neurologist injects the tiny cranial muscles as well as muscles along my neck and upper shoulder.  He uses a tiny needle and injects very little at each site.  He determines where the trigger points are before administering the Botox.  PLEASE NOTE:  If using Botox for migraines, do go to a neurologist who is experienced with migraine pain.  DO NOT have this done by a cosmetic surgeon!",high
albuterol,8,"albuterol asthma - Opened lungs when breathing was difficult. Stimulating--very. I used an asthma inhaler frequently as a child.  I think it was albuterol, although it is hard to be certain.

In my forties, I had a recurrence of asthma.  The pharmacist and my doctor both said NOT to use the over-the-counter inhalers.  I did try one, and it was MUCH more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  Dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.

At some point, I got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the Ventolin brand.  My doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.

I rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  But I try to keep one with me at all times because when I need it, I really need it.  I take long walks down and up a hill and if I had an attack at the bottom of the hill I would be in trouble.

It is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and I feel like I am suffocating--then I inhale Ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  It is a lifesaver.

As a child and teenager I did not mind the slight ""rush,""  I even liked it.  Part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug.",high
enbrel,9,"enbrel ankylosing spondylitis - My worst symptom was in my feet. It was painful to walk, and therefore I walked slowly even when I used shoes with good support (Birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. There was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. These were my symptoms when I was on methotrexate alone. When I started Enbrel, I felt the effects within hours. Within the same day I could walk decently with much less pain. Within the next few days and weeks, I'm practically back to normal. In my second month, I think I started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and I read about: I felt a faint shadow of the foot pains I used to experience but I can still move normally. None that I can tell I inject myself twice a week in the stomach area, which is a feat because until this happened, I was scared to death of getting injections.",high
neurontin,9,"neurontin spinal injury - The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile! Many of the medications I take have a side effect that affects your memory.  My short term memory is terrible.  I can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork, a pen, etc. and can not come up with the word, at all.  I'll be able to later, or the next day, I haven;t forgotten the word, I just can;t get it out of my brain.  The Neurontin has also affected my eyes.  I sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes I am able to read the phone book and othertimes I need magnifying glasses.  This all started a week after starting the medicine. I have a torn lumbar disk.  I have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working, I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time.",high
sarafem,10,"sarafem depression - I have taken this drug off and on for the past 13 years. I have always had good results with it, but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then, after my last child, I tried to make it without medication, but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However, I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner. Honestly, the only side effect I have had is that it is harder to have an orgasm. I can still have them, but it just takes longer. I don't really feel ""in the mood"" as much, but that is a very small detriment compared to what I was experiencing before. I have had no other side effects whatsoever. I do not even feel ""mediciney"" or out of it at all and no stomach problems, either. I am planning on seeing my doctor every 6 months and have my blood checked once a year to check my liver, etc., but so far am doing great. I do see a counselor every 2 weeks, which is invaluable to me.",high

prinivil,7,"prinivil high blood pressure - It did lower my blood pressure, although my physician wanted to lower it further because I started out on 10 mg a day so the medication doseage was raised to 20 mg which as been more effective at lowering my blood pressure.  Even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though I am young. On the 10 mg dosage I noticed that my throat was itchy and scratchy, causing a lot of cough and some gagging with the cough.  For some reason this problem disappeared when I was switched to the 20 mg dosage.  At times I get a bit of ringing in my ears but it is not regular.  I do notice fatigue and although I have started taking other medications after starting the lisinopril I think the lisinopril did affect my libido, although not a lot. Mostly pleased with lisinopril because it is effective at keeping my blood pressure down.  Due to a one time mail in problem with my prescription service I was off the lisinopril for approximately a week and my blood pressure went right back up, and was under control again a few days after starting up.  I keep track of my blood pressure at home and it regularly remains in a very good range of 128/60 or so with some variations.

A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating. I had headaches if I didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. I also have insomnia, however, if you cut your intake of caffeine, it shouldn't be too severe. I took this at noon. It's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day, I feel a bit strange. Either way, I know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions.

effexor-xr,7,"effexor-xr depression - Made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially. Weight gain, difficulty losing weight, blurry vision, general 'blah' moods. 
Attempted to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches, brain 'zaps', aggression, agitation, extreme mood swings and hives. Returned to 225mg (for a month now) and still experiencing severe hives & developing allergies to a number of things I wasn't allergic to before. Post-natal depression & major depression/anxiety.",high
effexor,10,"effexor recurrent depression - This drug turned my severe recurrent depression around. None. This drug changed my life. I have taken every antidepressant in the book. I received some benefit from most of them but my depression always returned and many of them had unpleasant side effects, including weight gain and constipation. This drug helped me enjoy life again. I still have occasional bouts of depression due to life cirsumstances but they are much briefer and less severe. I feel much more outgoing and enjoy being around people more. I no longer want to withdraw from the world and now face the world with much more confidence. For people worried that this drug produces an ""artificial"" feeling of happiness--this is not the case. This is the way people are supposed to feel. you will still have a normal range of moods. I only wish this drug had existed sooner--my whole life would have been differnt.",high
malarone,5,"malarone anti malarial - I didn't get malaria Prescribed to my Husband and I on our Honeymoon in Vietnam and Cambodia.  On day 4 we both experienced waves of strong abdominal pain every hour or so accompanied by a need to go to the toilet with diarrhoea (but it was non-urgent need to go to the loo - like a normal upset tummy can be). Initially believing that it was a normal holiday tummy upset we starved ourselves for nearly 4 days (we were also not hungry) but the waves of pain did not significantly subside - triggered by drinking water.   We then arrived at a Hotel in Vietnam that had Internet access and looked at some lonelyplanet blogs - the advice on Malarone was to make sure to follow the medication instruction leaflet to the letter i.e. to take it with a ""milky"" drink.   We then began to take it at breakfast with as many dairy products as we could - yoghurt, cheese, milk on cereal etc, and the symptoms subsided.  The pain ceased after a couple of days but we continued to have violent, liquid bowel movements for another week...  
It would help if the leaflet explained why dairy is recommended - is it the fat that is required or the alkaline environment?",high

I have far fewer hormonal breakouts around my chin and my skin seems generally less congested with fewer blackheads.  I have also noticed a reducation in oil on the surface of my skin. This product has made me more sensitive to the sun.  I think my skin has burned or discoloured very quickly after having been in the sun, even while wearing sunscreen.

avodart,7,"avodart hair loss - The treatment stopped hair loss and caused some regrowth.

Not perfect but works well enough that I don't want to quit taking. Starting it and titrating up caused interesting side effects: low blood sugar, big pupils, palpitations (all were temporary). Now if I miss a dose, I get bad night sweats and wierd dreams, and quickly remember to take it again. Started at 37.5 mg for few days, then 75 then 112.5 then 150mg.

yasmin,10,"yasmin cramps, birth control - Treatment benefits included prevention of pregnancy, clearer, more manageable skin, reduced menses and significantly reduced cramps. I never had another huge cystic acne after taking this medication. I had very VERY tiny acne occasionally. I mainly went to the doctor for heavy cramps. Now each month I do not suffer from cramps and am very happy. I was warned birth control can cause mood swings, I did not have any significant ones. Maybe around the time of my period. Also, I gained about 5 pounds after going on the pill, but lost it eventually by upping my exercise and watching closer what I ate. For some reason, I think it's easier to gain weight on this pill, but I don't know if it's just in my head. When I first got on this birth control, I had an intense craving for eggs and ate eggs 3 weeks straight. Again, I don't know if I'm imagining things but I would lose 5 pounds during the sugar pill? Maybe it's because I'm tired all of the time. I always take the pill at night with lots of water. I am told Yasmin increases the amount of potassium and extra water will flush out the excess. This could be a problem because there's been rumors (not confirmed, but rumors) Yaz might have to be either modified or off the market because of this, according to my doctor. It's expensive, I'm not going to lie. I pay almost 70 bucks per month because I have no insurance.  Make sure you exercise on this pill, because I really think it makes you sluggish easily so you could gain more weight. I've never tried generic.",high
accutane,9,"accutane acne - Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane. Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain... FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.",high

It works excellently in conjunction with a 2 week course of nebulised tobramycin (Tobi) to reduce symptoms and decrease sputum production. I believe one of its main actions is its anti inflammatory effect. Also I believe that it inhibits the ability of Pseudomonas to stick to the lungs. This is a great weapon in the arsenal against CF.

angeliq,9,"angeliq menopausal symptoms - hot flashes, sleep disturban - Markedly decreased hot flashes, which allowed for better sleep. Reversal of vaginal atrophy symptoms and vaginal dryness, and the accompanying itching and irritation. I have not experienced any side effects to date. According to my doctor, I am one of the small percentage of women who become more symptomatic as time goes by after menopause.  I had stopped hormone replacement therapy after the Women's Health Initiative Study as a result of the negative findings of the Study.  Over a period of several years, I was increasingly bothered by the disturbed sleep resulting from hot flashes and the vaginal discomforts mentioned above, and so reluctantly decided to resume taking hormones.  The doctor stated that Angeliq provided a low dose and that the progestin was closer to that which our body naturally produces. I took it daily for about a year. For the last six months, I have, with the doctor's approval, decreased use from every night to five nights during the week and none on the week-end.

I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy, also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything, it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit, my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified. Bad withdrawels upon quiting medication. Sexual side effects, My senses seemed dulled. Took 75 mgs once daily for about three months, then wheened myself of it.

coumadin,9,"coumadin dvt - The clots eventually completely dissolved over the course of the treatment. I had to be careful shaving my legs. I had to pay attention to which foods and alcohol would alter my prothrombin time and make it necessary to take a higher or lower dosage, i. e. be sure to have the guacamole if I indulged in a margarita! After being diagnosed with thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis twice - once in each leg - the first time through a veinogram and the second time through an ultrasound, I had 11 days in the hospital both times on IV heparin with complete bed rest while my clots which were in the saphenous vein all the way up to the femoral junction, were dissolving.  After my release from the hospital I had 6 months of coumadin therapy.  Through the years I have had sclerotherapy and infrared venous closure procedures. My vein disease has much improved except for capillary bruing/bleeding under the skin which would be considered more of a cosmetic problem, except that it bleeds in one spot that has come to my skin's surface when I bump it,scratch it, or hit it shaving.",high
lamisil,1,"lamisil toenail fungus - I did not see a change in the condition of the toenail. Only about a quarter if the left great toenail was affected. After taking the drug for the 12 weeks, the physician recommended another 12 week course, however my insurance company would not cover the extended treatment and I could not afford the cost of Lamisil. Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment none I was to take the drug for 12 weeks after having liver function studies performed.

vagifem,1,"vagifem vaginal dryness and urinary tract infections - Using Vagifem for the first 18 months was brilliant. It increased lubrication and stopped the continual urethral soreness I had (and when passing water). It made everything feel normal again. During the first 18 months I noticed slight water retention when I used it, and my hot flushes also came back to a lesser degree. 

Then recently I got a new batch of Vagifem, and I had a horrible allergic reaction - dizziness, sinus pain, severe palpitations and panic. My eyes, hands and feet went really puffy and it made my vagina and urinary tract really sore. 

I've since tried another new batch with the same problems. This is so disappointing. I've gone back to an older batch with no problems (except that I've now run out!).

With all the above mentioned medicines, I've always started to get stomach problems on the fourth day. I stopped taking the medicine after side effects appeared.",Low
valtrex,9,"valtrex cold sores - Valtrex tablets work by stopping the multiplication of the virus which causes herpes. They can reduce the length and severity of an outbreak of herpes, the duration of pain and shorten the time to healing of crusts associated with herpes. Valtrex tablets help the blisters to heal more quickly. If you start
taking them as soon as you feel an outbreak starting, you may actually
prevent the blisters from developing. I did not have any ""observable"" or noticeable side effects while taking Valtrex.  However, I was forewarned that Valtrex has the following side effects:  headache, gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea,constipation, abdominal pain,indigestion).  Also because I was taking Valtrex to prevent outbreaks triggered by laser treatments, I was advised that Valtrex causes sensitivity to UV light and my skin would be much more vulnerable to sunburn even during very short exposure to UV light. I took Valtrex before a laser treatment to prevent the outbreak of cold sores or herpes virus.  The first laser treatment without taking Valtrex caused a herpes/cold sores breakout on my face around the chin area.  After consulting with my physician, he prescribed Valtrex to prevent the outbreaks in future laser treatments.  I learned that the laser triggered the herpes outbreak, since the virus is in a dormant state until it is disturbed and activated by the laser.  I was prescribed 500 mg of Valtrex to be taken 3 days before the treatment, the day of the treatment and three days after the treatment, for a total of seven days.  I took the medication twice a day and started this seven day regime each and every time I had a laser treatment to prevent any outbreaks.",high

accutane,5,"accutane cystic acne - The drug cleared my skin and even reduced some of the redness and scarring from the acne.  This was my first and last treatment. severe sexual side effects began about 2 months into the trial including pain during intercourse, soreness lasting as long as 24 hours followed by periods as long as 2 weeks or more where intercourse was impossible due to intense pain upon penetration, vaginal dryness, and the inability to have a vaginal orgasm.  I also had overall skin dryness, but using a daily moisturizer and medicated chapstick made this very manageable. treatment began with two 40mg tablets twice a day, but was reduced to once a day after the first month due to extremely dry skin.  When sexual side effects began in month 2, my dermatologist suggested using a personal lubricant during sex (which was never needed before treatment began) and that the problem would clear up once I was finished with the treatment. I began the treatment in Febuary 2007 and finished September 2007.  The problem with dry skin cleared up rapidly, but I continue to struggle with the sexual side effects (as of June 2008).  I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge.

I stayed on this drug for several years, along with using topical medications.  I was using so many prescriptions that I don't really know which if any of them helped.  I always still had some acne during this treatment. Chronic yeast infections leading to daily use of nystatin, yogurt, suppliments, etc.  Especially since treatment spanned high school and college years, the effect of having recurring yeast infections was particularly worrisome.  I also did not know when I was prescribed nystatin to deal with the yeast infections from minocycline that the nystatin could have negative long-term effects on my liver. During my teens, I took minocycline several times a day for many years.  I was also using various topical medications, and at some point, also took different antibiotics such as Bactrim.

I did not do well with Fosomax, so was given Actonel, and then a once a month Actonel.. My Health Care program persuaded me to take the generic once a week, because it was cheaper.  I find no difference in the once a week or once a month side effects. Actonel or its generic is taken to stop bone loss- which is especially prevalent in thin white older women. It is a pill taken once a week on an empty stomach upon rising in the morning.  After the pill is taken with an 8 oz glass of water, the patient must remain upright  for 30 minutes.

I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about, i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect. After a while I seemed to notice that I was mildly 'groggy' for several hours after waking up. I was working at a garden center at the time and was frequently forgetting where I had left something. The joke was that I had my own private 'lost and found'. Not sure what this means. I was prescribed this drug for insomnia which could have been menopausal related. I took the drug nightly for approximately two years. About half way thru this time I tried to quit but the insomnia returned so I continued. The second time I successfully quite and have not had a problem since that time.",high

I was uncomfortable, however i have been 1 1/2 year without it and i barely get a little zit anymore. pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. There is a great deal of monitoring with this drug... so you really have to be committed to using it (i.e., blood work, frequent dermatology visits, one month waiting period for women to be sure you get on oral birth control, monthly phone questionnaire with the company). I began the medication at a dose of 30 mg once daily and it was increased to 60 mg... which became the maximum i could handle without significant discomfort.",high

This medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood. I would have mild itching I began taking this medication as prescribed but it put me in such a good mood I began taking more...and needing more. It works great for anxiety also but when I stopped taking it I had the most horrible withdrawls. I could not sleep. My insides felt like they were jumping. I was awfully tired and depressed. I could not keep my arms and legs still when i sat down. It was horrible. I WAS ADDICTED TO THIS MEDICATION AND I STILL AM.  I am still trying to wean off of it.

The Wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer. No Activity for six weeks as patient was a truckdriver for a living and fell in the bathroom at home and broke her rib.  It was floating around and lung puncture was the greatest concern.  The Flexril made the patient relax to almost oblivion therefore disabling her ability to move around.

keflex,1,"keflex severe upper respitory tract infection - Mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox. Unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits, and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present. Swollen glands, especially in breasts. My breasts became enlarged and very painful, causing my doctor to diagnose pregnancy. Of course this was not the case, as I tested negative for pregnancy, and my doctor was reluctant to believe that the Keflex had anything to do with it. My father noted same side effects after a similar course of Keflex. He developed painful and swollen glands in mouth and neck. Also, the management of the URTI took much longer than with other antibiotics. My symptoms seemed to linger on and on. I had a severe URTI with bronchial coughing, headache,  muscular and joint pains, and general feeling of fatigue. My doctor presecribed Keflex as an antibiotic, she regarded it as a most effective treatment for this severe URTI. I was to take one tablet (I forget the dosage) once a day for a week to ten days. As I was working I had  no time to rest and had to rely on Panamax to held suppress the symptoms. Unfortunately within a day  my breasts became sore and swollen, and at the end of the week I returned to my GP who tried to diagnose pregnancy when there was not the slightest possibility of this.

aromasin,8,"aromasin eostrogen-positive breast cancer - During the 4 years so far [out of 5], I have had no recurrance of the tumour and no additional tumours have been detected by ultra-sound, mammogram, and twice-yearly check-ups. Perhaps the greatest benefit is the gradual reduction in stress experienced as a result of my on-going stabilised condition after a lumpectomy. I had some initial swelling of my hip, knee and ankle joints in the morning which slowly subsided during the day. The medication also aggravated the hot-flushes of the menopause, making them initially frequent and copious, and on-going for the treatment duration so far - tho with reduced frequency now in Year 4. I also experience considerable thirst. I was put on Aromasin after 6 months on Tamoxifen because I suffered debilitating muscle cramps on Tamoxifen as well as joint problems and extreme hot flushes. Aromasin has been kinder, and so far I have taken it daily for 4 years out of an initial 5. It may be prescribed beyond 5 years, I'm not sure. It has relatively slight side effects now but in the first 6 months I was conscious of its effects on my body - not intolerable by any means, just noticable.",high

Her doctor was aware of her smoking and blood pressure.   At one point in her hrt therapy she was injecting Premarin per doctors orders.  Now at age 76, grand mom continues to take Premarin because she was told by her doctor that it is the fountain of youth. She is very vain and does not care if this drug kills her as long as she looks young.  She looks and acts older than her actual age.  The risk do not out weigh the benefit.  HRT should only be used to ease a woman into menopause.  Grand mom still has hot flashes after 40 years of HRT.

It's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks.

The ED was the most difficult side effect and I have not consulted my physician about this. My psychiatrist, who issued the drug, does not issue ED medication because he does not have facilities to evaluate my other health needs. Another mild side effect is that if I miss a dose it seems like I have a mild racing heart. Withdrawal symptom. this will occur several hours after a missed dose.

ortho-tri-cyclen,7,"ortho-tri-cyclen prevent pregnancy - Ortho Tri Cyclen effectively prevented pregnancy, cleared up acne, gave me regular periods, helped with iron deficiency due to blood loss Thinning hair, bleeding gums, eventually the iron deficiency came back I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen at age 20.  It gave me regular periods (they aren't really 'periods,' they are just a withdrawl from the hormones) and less cramping, lighter flow.  It got rid of my acne. I did not get pregnant in my 7.5 years of taking the drug.  I think that eventually the pill prevents you from absorbing nutrients because my iron deficiency came back. I am not sure if the nutrient absorption has anything to do with having bleeding gums more often, but I did have a lot of pain because of a dislodged clot when I got my wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon said that this happens more often to women who take birth control. I stopped taking the pill to find more natural ways of birth control, and because my hair was becoming thin and brittle.

retin-a-micro,8,"retin-a-micro acne - blackheads and acne scars - Blackheads are gone. Pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. Acne scars faded. Skin looks more polished. A few days a week, my face would be red, very sensitive, and peeling. Then it would be back to normal and then a few days later the peeling starts again. I use this drug to help with the overall appearance of my skin, especially blackheads, pore size, and acne scars. I don't have any wrinkles, so I can't comment on how well it worked for that. But hopefully it is preventing wrinkles from ever developing. I only use it twice a week now coz my skin is very sensitive. Once I get more used to the drug, I will slowly increase the frequency. During the first two weeks of use, I didn't really notice any changes except that my skin was drier and started to peel a little. By the third week, I started seeing my blackheads disappearing and my pores changing. They actually looked bigger. Then after 2 months of continued usage, my pores got smaller, acne scars faded and blackheads are almost completely gone. Few days a week I would have red, irritated peeling skin. But nothing extremley terrible or intolerable. With good moisturizer and calming face creams, I'm able to minimize my peeling to a point where it doesn't bother me that much.

qvar,10,"qvar asthma - The treatment benefits of QVAR are that I do not think about my condition. Also, it is easy to execute the treatment.  I exercise and go about my day as if I were not afflicted with asthma.  I do not worry about having an attack, which is a big relief.  The treatment is inconspicuous, another plus. I am fortunate in saying that there are no side effects at the dose I am taking. Each morning, I take out my AeroChamber that holds the QVAR.  I shake the QVAR aerosol canister and place it back into the AeroChamber.  I then empty my lungs of air and take a big puff of the QVAR. I hold it in my lungs for as long as possible before breathing out.  I repeat this process at night before retiring. I expect to be using QVAR for the foreseeable future.",high
flexeril,8,"flexeril muscle spasms (upper back/neck) - Quick and lasting relief of back and neck pain and muscle spasms. The effects are felt after about 1 hour, and full effects are felt after 1 1/2 hours, and about 80% of the pain and tension are relieved for about 4-6 hours. If stretching of the muscles is done while on the medicine, the pain and tension are greatly reduced for longer than the 4-6 hours. If the medicine is taken before bed, morning pain and tension are reduced about 50%. Drowsiness (moreso when already tired). If the medicine is taken after 8-10 hours of sleep the drowsiness is manageable. If the medicine is taken after not much sleep, the drowsiness interferes with functioning. The medicine is taken once per day at night, about 2 hours before bed. Once the medicine fully kicks in (after about 1 1/2 hours), special stretches are done. Stretching along with the medicine provides about 90% relief from pain and tension, and the relief lasts longer than medicine alone. The medicine is also taken as when pain and tension are worse than average.",high

7. Bad experience for $200!!! Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun. Please be aware, read more information online.",Low

Then, I started getting ulcers on my tongue.  They spread to my gums and inside lips and my tongue was swollen, making it difficult to talk.  I was afraid that if I got stopped, driving, the cop would think I was drunk, because I was slurring my words.  Now, several days after stopping the drug, I still have extreme fatigue. I'm hoping to return to normal!  When I had pneumonia, I actually felt fine, but the cough had to to be treated.  I doubt if I would ever take Ciprofloxacin again.

effexor,8,"effexor depression - The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt ""paralyzed,"" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.). The only side effect I noticed was that if, for some reason, I forgot to take the effexor in the morning, by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way. I'm not clear on what is wanted in this section.  I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so.

One night, the burning feeling was so intense, I had to wash it off.  I was quite worried, as this medicine was out of date, and I thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  Originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne, but I had read online that it might be helpful for age spots. I applied a small amount, probably more than I needed to, to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  Before many nights had passed, I noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  Before long, the age spots just seemed to peel off, as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.

ranitidine,9,"ranitidine gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd) - I began suffering from ""heartburn"" in my late thirties. This condition progressed to a daily occurence. Not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero. I am not aware of any side effects. However that does not mean I have not experienced any. I think headaches are a side effect and I get them occasionally, but I cannot tie it to the medication. In any case I do not experience any kind of debilitating medical problems or even annoying ones that I can link to taking ranitidine. I take a 150mg tablet in the morning before or during breakfast and then another at lunch. This combination prevents heartburn throughout the day. Late night dinners may produce heartburn, often I'll take a tablet prior or immediately after as prevention. Also I elevated my bed about 2"" at the head to prevent what had been fairly frequent events of stomach acid somehow working its way into my mouth at night.

Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet. With Prilosec, I occasionally had stomach cramping and nausea, but I did not experience any side effects with Nexium. I took 1 capsule (40 MG) of Nexium daily for 30 days.

wellbutrin-xl,10,"wellbutrin-xl anti-depressant - The biggest benefit was when I quit smoking, because I had been taking it for a while...it proved to assist with the cravings...it's probably why I was able to quit in the first place. Made me kind of grumpy and a little weight gain. Started taking anti-depressant when my Mother passed away.  Started a low-dose and increased over a period of 3 months.  I believe Wellbuterin was very beneficial and did not have major side effects.  I stopped taking them 2 months ago and haven't had any withdrawal symptoms.",high
wellbutrin,8,"wellbutrin depression - The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants. At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive. I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore.",high
acyclovir,9,"acyclovir cold sores/fever blisters - It is very effective, especially if you take it early enough. But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times. The sad thing is, I'm only allowed 4 refills a year, so I have to lower my dosage, but, it still works. spotting/cramping between periods, which didnt happen till I started taking this medicine. I take 3 per day for about 2- 3 days on the onset of a cold sore. I recommend you use as directed, also be sure to drink PLENTY of liquids (no alcohol) while taking the medicine. Also, be sure you arent on any other medications that effect your kidneys, liver, or stomach. Also, only take it on the ONSET of a cold sore. Not every day for the rest of your life.",high
minoxidil,9,minoxidil hair loss - Regained hair growth. Minoxidil first increased hairloss (normal during the first weeks of using). New hair started to grow after around seven months. I have now regained my normal hairgrowth. The hairs itself have a slightly larger diameter and are bit more curled. Slightly increased peachy hairgrowth on face. During first week of treatment I experienced a minor headache after application. Was prescribed this drug in a 5% solution by my dermatologist when suffering from Alopecia Androgenetica. He advised to apply a 1 ml dose twice daily.,high

neurontin,1,"neurontin genitofemoral nerve damage - No treatment benefits. the edema was so severe that the abdominal wall was pushed out, causing the genitofemoral nerve to pull even more, so pain was increased. whole body swelling (even my eyelids), palpitations, breathlessness, dry mouth, severe constipation, anxiety, increased physical agitation, weight gain. Loss of short term memory, confusion, dizziness and nausea. After a rectocele prolapse operation in June 2009, i suffered groin damage from the position I'd been laid in for surgery.  The genitofemoral nerve was stitched into and i was left suffering from a combination of abdominal pain like appendicitis, and sharp pain when moving my right leg. Eleven months later, and i was still breathless with pain, and could not walk without twisting my body to guard it. 
i was offered gabapentin, but was swollen within 24 hours, and only managed to move my bowels three times in eight weeks - not good when the reason all this stated was a rectocele caused by megacolon.
When i withdrew i became suicidal, absolutely despairing, for three weeks. Two months on, my weight gain has not come down, and the palpitations are if anything worse. Not my sort of drug.",Low
sotret,10,"sotret acne - Smooth, clear skin.  The Roaccutane not only got rid of my acne but also rejuvenated my skin.  Pores were finer, blackheads were gone. Dry lips, red skin for the first month or so. Treatment consisted of orally taking two tablets a day.  I was prescribed Cetaphil lotion and lip balm to keep side effects at bay. Roaccutane was an excellent treatment.  Before going on it I spent hundreds of dollars on other anti-acne treatments such as Clearasil etc and had no joy.  Don't waste your money on other treatments just see your GP and ask for Roaccutane if you have an ongoing acne problem.",high
evoclin,5,evoclin acne - The acne cleared up but the evoclin was used in combination with proactiv.  Proactiv was used before and then started getting acne again. Then I was given evoclin and used both and the acne cleared up and the whiteheads and blackheads disappeared.  there was also a increase in the softness and suppleness of the facial skin. As far as I know there are no side effects. I wash with proactiv in the morning and at night. I apply the evoclin at night only.,high

It has been 10 years and my acne never returned. dry lips solved by lip balm
mild dry mouth; solved by drinking more water I was started on a low dose, which cleared my acne in a couple of months but my doctor then had me repeat another 4 month session to make sure the clearing of my skin was permanent.

levoxyl,10,"levoxyl low thyroid production - After 2 years of treating hypothydoidism with 100 mgr dose, the patient was able to lower the dose to 88 mgr per day. Thyroid levels are now normal. No side effects have been observed so far. Started 4 years ago with a 100 mgr dose and after 2 years of daily use changed to 88 mgr due to a positive effect of the drug. Besides taking levothyroxine, the patient is also practicing yoga exercises that stimulate thyroid gland.",high
avage,8,"avage to achieve a smoother skin surface - Very effective in obtaining a mild peel, to slough off dead skin cells, every 15 days or so. Using it for more than 3 days at a stretch caused excessive peeling, which was visible even under makeup. Redness and rawness was also present. A break of a few days was required before restarting the treatment. Tazarotene cream was applied to the face at bedtime and washed off in the morning",high
sarafem,3,sarafem anxiety - I did not find any benefit really.  In fact it seemed to make me more anxious. Anxiety I was prescribed this because of anxiety and mild depression by my GP but it did not improve my condition and seemed to make my anxiety worse.  My anxiety was partly due to my personality and partly due to the fact that I had a mentally ill son which caused me a lot of worry and stress.   My GP thought that SSRI's may help and prescribed fluoxetine.   This did not help and he changed me to Cipramil which suited me better as it did not make my anxiety worse but it did not really help my anxiety that much so I stopped taking this as well.,Low

I have been using it everytime I feel pain in my stomach. I did not have heart burn though. It was only treated for pain/ulcer purposes. None. I did not feel any side effects whatsoever.The only thing is that it does not work inmediately like other pills. It takes several days for the pill to start working, but it does do the job.

While the initial male pattern baldness is mild, I fear worsening of the condition, and am taking this as a preventive measure. I experienced sharp bursts of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy-two hours of commencing treatment. These subsided and may or may not be related to the medication. I began taking the product to stave off the onset of male pattern baldness. As the treatment is said to show full effects in two years, my four-week course is probably not enough to show results. I will report again in due time.",high

retin-a-micro,10,"retin-a-micro sun damage to face - The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience. Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow. Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!
When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me.",high
panixine-disperdose,10,"panixine-disperdose skin infection - My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.

doxycycline,9,"doxycycline cat bite - I have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. I had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). I was told I was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. So I was warned to take all of these or I'd be back later for IV treatment and it would be a far longer course. Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects. There was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what I standardly use -- yogurt.

The side effects began about 7-10 days after starting the Asacol. The nausea and vomiting was not immediately associated with Asacol but was attributed to possibly having the flu.

May focus is better on this drug than all the years (about 15) I have been treated for ADD. None as long as you don't miss any doses.  Missing more than one dose results in vertigo.  I'm sure there are very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it. I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder in my early 30's.  I tried different treatments...ritalin (terrible side effects), adderall (didn't work well alone), Adderall with Effexor (Worked great but is hell on your sex life) and then Adderall with Wellbutrin.  I took the Adderall with Welbutrin for 10 years but had to take ambien to sleep. Heart palpatations are another side effect of that combo.

So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism. I have only had one side effect due to mixing Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) with Maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness. It has been only 1 week of taking Cyclobenzaprine so I may experience different side effects the more I take it. So far this medication has worked for me. I did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this 1 week. I started this medication around the same time I start to get PMS symptoms ""Mainly very moody and argumentative"" and I'm amazed how Cyclobenzaprine effected my PMS symptoms.

effexor-xr,2,"effexor-xr depression, axiety - Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over. It almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my 20 and 35 points respectively (up to about 105/170), as well as elevating my heart rate from 75 beats per minute to 95-100 beats. I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit). The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg. If I were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it, even with the withdrawal. Otherwise, I'm staying away from SSNRI's for a long time.",Low

mevacor,2,"mevacor originally brain lesions then lower cholesterol - I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors. After increasing the dosage to 20 mgs to also reduce my cholesterol levels, I started to experience extreme pain in my arm muscles. Originally I started taking it to see if it would have any positive effect on the number and size of brain lesions I had. I had experienced an increasing inability to handle job stress, was losing my concentration abilities and was becoming increasingly forgetful. I believe it did have some positive effect in reducing the size and number of brain lesions, but not to the effect of improving my cognitive thinking ability to the extent I could return to work. Two years later, my doctor wanted me to increase the dosage to reduce my cholesterol levels.  Shortly after increasing my dosage, I started to experience chronic pain in my arms.  I finally did some research and discovered muscle pain to be a ""side effect"" when taking statin drugs.  When I stopped taking Lovastatin, the pain went away after a few months.",Low
seroquel,1,"seroquel insomnia - As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia The side effects of this medication in combination with the patient's medical condition and current medications were tremendous and in my opinion contributed to the patient's death.  The patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  The patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and I believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  The family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred, the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  It was more than 20 minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the ER for treatment.  The patient was pronounced dead on the scene. The patient was referred to the psychiatrist by his cardiologist secondary to depression and increasing insomnia.  The patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  The psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  Slowly the family started noticing strange behavior, delusions, and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a 4 month period and began to get more severe.  The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  Even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death, the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  The family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.  We do not plan to seek legal retribution but hope that anyone that reads this will be more cautious about prescribing seroquel in someone that already has cardiac problems and to please be careful about it's possible interactions with other medications!",Low

She put me on 10mg first.After 3-4 weeks I went back and asked for her to increase it. She prescribed 20mg,(which I found they don't make 20mg doses) Instead of changing it to a proper mg, she decided to have me take 2 10mg pills every morning which also doubled the cost and that amount was not enough to have much benefit. After about a year , I was finally prescribed a therapeutic dosage of 40mg. I had too many problems with the pharmacy ordering the right amount ( they had me take 4 10mg pills a day because they didn't order the right ones! I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order , I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $130.00 at the 10mgs, so X 2 for 20mg, x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing it.Scamming the federal programs or  something...so I finally just quit taking it.

neurontin,5,"neurontin degenerative disc disorder, spinal stenosis l1-s1 - Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic. Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others. Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory).",high

I told myself that I would take it forever if I had to......anything to not feel what I had been feeling for years:  depressed that I'm not good enough. In the past few years I've tried to get off of it by reducing my dose.  I cut my pills in half (to 50 mg) and after a few weeks went through a depression that REALLY sucked.  But I got through it.  When I tried to take it down to 25 mg, I got really depressed again and it wouldn't go away.  I went back up to 50mg and am still there. When I try again to cut back on the dose, I think I'll go to a psychiatrist while doing it.

I was swollen from my breasts to my toes and attributed this to the surgery.I had told my doctor that I couldn't tolerate a high does of ibuprofen so she prescribed the generic toradol as pain relief. When the swelling showed no signs of abating, I looked up the drug's side effects and saw that swelling of the torso, thighs and legs was listed. I was trying to reduce the swelling so I stopped taking it and switched to 1 ibuprofen 4 times a day. That relieved the pain and the swelling immediately started to go down.

clonazepam,5,"clonazepam agoraphobia, panic disorder - Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life. The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount. I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.

femring,1,"femring hysterectomy - The Femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. This allows you freedom for the next three months, (90) days until your reorder a new ring.  Also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments. The bad thing about this certain dosage of the Femring was on the third day it seemed as though I was beginning to have vaginal irritation.  The fourth day was obvious vaginal irritation with a blistery rash.  Upon feeling and seeing this rash I removed the Femring and called my Dr. A lower dose Femring was prescribed, 0.05mg/day, which does a good job of returning my horomones levels to close to normal.",Low

I now use the medication only on an as needed basis rather than take it daily, which is not necessary as my energy levels vary quite a bit. It was also suggested that I try Flexoril (sp) to see if the cause for my fatigue was caused by pain or discomfort which kept me from getting adequate sleep. That was not effective unless I wanted to miss  a day from even more fatigue than usual.",high

I felt like I had to constantly get up and move around, but it didn't even help.  I couldn't sit still, had major problems sleeping at night, AND started gaining weight. I was prescribed Abilify (15mg/daily) to assist in moderating my mood.

It didn't make me jittery. It just boosted my energy. It did give me considerable dry mouth. I did notice that I would be a little more tired if I didn't take it for a couple of days. I think it is mildly addictive. Overall, I gained more benefit from it than negatives. I did worry about blood pressure because it did seem to increase my heartrate. I would recommend it to those who suffer from mild depression and/or just need a little extra energy boost. The medication is actually to treat narcolepsy, a condition in which a patient falls asleep at random times and has trouble staying awake.

Maybe it's the combination that helps. I was recently taking Pristiq and Mirtazapine and was terribly depressed. I quit taking the Pristiq and began Lamictal and had and a very quick improvement. Lamictal seems to have increased my sex drive. I'm constantly ""horny"" and masturbate alot. The crazy thing is that Lamictal also seems to cause anorgasmia.....difficulty in achieving orgasm. Most of the time I get 99.9% of the way towards feeling like I'm going to climax but don't. So this med has increased my sex drive but doesn't let me fully enjoy the ""benefits"".

After a few days I was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer, and my overall infection was getting worse. I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again.

I think tomorrow I will feel a little better, great again when I am on the Prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation.

I usually do not take the afternoon dose unless I feel really tired and nervous about driving.",high
zegerid,8,"zegerid acid reflux - I have a great reduction in stomach acid problems. When I've tried to use natural products like Alo Vera juice or licorice-based products, to take care of the problem, it is very difficult, and I have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. So taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day, though I often begin to get some acid in the evening. As far as I can tell, there are no side effects. I have heard things about these proton inhibitors doing something to the bones, though, making for bone problems, but there's no way I can tell whether it's happening to me. My bone situation has actually improved while on this medication because I've been working out in the gym with weights. The simplicity is one of the best features. I take the pill with a glass of water first thing in the morning, wait at least 1/2 an hour before eating anything, and I'm done!",high
desyrel,7,"desyrel depression - decrease in depression and suicidal thoughts. Gives more energy to be productive in life. Feel more positive and less inclined to take naps during the day to escape from depression. extreme tiredness and for this reason must be taken before bed. Also in higher doses which are more effective, it can cause some temporary memory loss. Can be blurry vision immediately after taking drug. just an everyday for the rest of my life treatment. It is very hard for me to get off the drug and take a break, I immediately feel terrible and then can't sleep.",high
erythromycin,7,"erythromycin acne on my back - I started noticing changes on my back I started having alot of abdominal pain, and the urge to go to the bathroom, I had a bladder infection. I would also get a headache once in awhile I started taking minocycline, although it made me really sick so I then went to this drug",high
propecia,8,propecia hair lose - I grew about half my hair back on top of my head. Erection not as strong. I'm using the generic brand to save money. I've been using it for 6 to 7 months and I noticed hair regrowth within the second month.i did not do any research on the side effects and now that I think of it my eractions arn't what they use to be. I'm wondering if I stop using this drug if I will start balding again and the side effects will go away?,high
keflex,1,"keflex tooth infection - Really cut down the tooth infection/pain and swollen glands, during the first course of treatment I did not have any side effects at all. Severe diarrhea, very severe vomiting I was given keflex (3x daily) for an infected root canal that needed to be redone. The swelling, pain and swollen glands subsided substantially while I was waiting 2 weeks for my appt to have the root canal redone. After the root canal, the dentist put me back on the keflex (2x daily) to insure against further infection, also since I have mitral valve prolapse. After 2 doses I developed diarrhea and took .5mg of immodium (I am sensitive to immodium, only need a very small dose). 8 hours later I developed worse diarrhea and then very severe vomiting, stomach pain, severe headache, dizziness, chills. Also my muscles were shaking and cramping as if I was very cold. I had to be taken to the urgent care, received an injection of phenergan which helped, and told never to take keflex again. Flu test was negative, I had not eaten anything during that day which could have caused food poisoning. Dx: gastroenteritis caused by keflex.",Low

valtrex,9,"valtrex cold sores - Decreased symptoms Didnt feel any side effects. I've been suffering from cold sores all my life, usually getting one after a cold in the winter season. If my stress levels are up i usually get one as well either under my nose or on my lips. After finally using valtex my symptoms were reduced to 7 days. Prior to that i would be suffering for almost 3 weeks with theses bad boys!!!! Key to survival, take this pill as soon as u feel the tingle, if not it will come just not as bad.",high
voltaren,2,voltaren chronic back pain - I was perscribed this after I decided to quite narcotic pain killers.  I was taking fairly large doses of Oxycotin and switched to Voltaren 75mg.  They will not touch my pain.  I guess I have a high tolerance for pain meds.  I don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain. Upset stomach. I was perscribed 75mgs X 2 per day.  I take double that amount and still have very little relief.,Low
klonopin,8,klonopin anxiety - being able to sleep/decrease anxiety surrounding  getting to sleep and staying asleep. Also taken during times of high anxiety. Helped to control anger outbursts and uncontrolled anxiety. sometimes a hangover effect in the morning if I took it late in the evening and had to get up early. Need about 10 hours to have it leave the system. take as needed for anxiety when going to bed/sleep. I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep and this medication seemed to take the edge off of my anxiety so that I could fall asleep and then stay asleep. Or at least get back to sleep and not feel startled.,high
wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl depression - I had been on many different treatments for depression throughout most of my adult life and the side effects seamed to outweigh the benefits.  Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  I had a 5 lb weight loss in the beginning that I have maintained.  Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past. Side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently I have been having trouble concentrating, my memory has been poor.  Generally I feel like my iq has dropped  I have also been very teary and find myself crying a fair amount over small incidences almost like I was pregnant.  None of this may have anything to do with the medication but I am concerned. I went up to 450mg once a day but cut back to 300mg a day about 6-8 mnths ago and didn't find I was less able to cope with my depression. I do find that I feel depressed more often but I recognize the signs of the depression and use coping stragies to deal with what is happening.",high
neurontin,8,"neurontin restless leg syndrome - Reduced pain in legs and forearms, and blocked the pain from the arthritis in my lower back.  The pain in my legs from the RLS is considerably lessoned.  I also was in chronic pain from my arthritis, but can now move around without any pain, (unless I lift or do any type of work that is strenuous), but I used to be in so much pain that I would cry, so it was definitely worth it for me to take Neurontin. None. Three 600 mg. tabs in the a.m. and three 600 mg. tabs at bedtime.",high
nuvaring,5,"nuvaring birth control - Very easy birth control method. You don't have to worry about taking a pill every day. Day to day I can't feel it at all and my husband can't either. Stays in place. I've been more moody the past few weeks. I have also experince increased nausea. My GERD has acted up as well. My husband cannot feel it and normally I can't either, but ""while in use"" It has been pinching me. I'm hoping these side effects will go away if I continue use. none",high
ambien,9,"ambien insomnia - Fast- acting, works in 15-20 mins. No side effects! I've had insomnia since I was a kid--couldn't shut the old mind down. I used Tylenol PM for years but it stopped working for me. Ambien has been great. It usually puts me to sleep within thirty minutes though I have had trouble getting to sleep after eating too much before bedtime. I have very active dreams, but always have had. If I try to fight it and stay up, I do hallucinate and have said and done things I don't remember. My sons tell me funny stories. I feel great the next day and don't feel drugged at all.",high
darvocet-n,6,"darvocet-n pain - Treatment benefits were to address pain and discomfort.  It was perscribed to me after I was in the hospital instead of Vicaden (spelling?), as Vicaden does not suite me well.  The medication began working after about 45 minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over 6 hours. Treatment side effects for me were nausea and feeling unclear or 'loopy'. I found that if I took more than one pill within six hours, I became very nauseated.  In addition, I would not have been able to function properly or drive a car comfortably because of the side effects with my clarity. The treatment was for pain and was taken by myself for a situation that could not have been allieviated by medical attention.  I had an ovarian cyst rupture.  My doctor and the ER told me there was really nothing for them to do other than wait for it to be reabsorbed.  So, pain medication was my last resort.  I took a few of these pills over two days to help alleviate my extreme pain.",high
lorazepam,9,lorazepam sleep problems - able to sleep through the night sometimes difficult to wake up prescribed by a psychiatrist after the patient failed to get good results with over the counter sleep remedies.,high
fexofenadine,8,"fexofenadine seasonal allergy - Controlled itching in eyes, nasal and chest congestion, and ""tickle cough"" very well No direct side effects but I used to take OTC allergy med (loratidine) except during extreme periods, then I would switch to the prescription for two months or so.  Now the allergy seems unresponsive to the over the counter medication, no matter what time of year it is.  I do not know if my allergy has changed or if I have become dependent on the fexofenadine. One 180 mg tablet each morning as needed for sinus.",high
lamictal,9,"lamictal bipolar ii - lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings I've been lucky with side effects. It has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. Regardless, the effects have been minimal and WELL worth it considering how much I've been helped. I started treatment when I was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation. I was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

I have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia, but I doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way.",high
tramadol,9,"tramadol abdominal pain - I have severe pain in my lower abdomin that was so strong I couldn't sleep nor move around very well. Luckily I sit mostly at work so I was able to deal with a little while, but eventually I went to the ER and they prescribed me this. Which I have never heard or taken before. I have read that a lot of people who take this are very tired and sleepy. I believe that everyone's body reacts differently to drugs. As far as my side effects goes I feel great. Almost a natural ""high"" if you will. I am very talkative and focused. I will say that I do not have much of an appetite. My stomach feels fine and the lower pain has gone away for the most part. I do realize I am taking more pills now because the effectivness has worn off a bit, doing my research on this I have heard that being the case many times. Overall I am going to a OBGYN specialist next week and they are going to  determine what is the exact problem. As urgent care and the hospitalcould not figure it out, which scares me truthfully. Hopefully I will not have to take anything and the pain will go away. I recommend this to anyone who has moderate to severe pain as it has helped me dramatically, good luck to all. Pain is not something I wish on anyone.",high
paxil,10,"paxil depression and anxiety - Paxil quickly improved my depression and also helped with mild anxiety issues I was experiencing.  I was very pleased with the speed with which my depression improved.  Within four weeks I was feeling better than I had felt in a very long time.  I have been on it for two months and am still improving. During the second week I experienced stomach problems.  I had diarrhea that lasted for about a week.  I also had moderate headaches which lasted a little longer than the stomach issues. I went to the doctor due to problems associated with my depression.  I had been taking Wellbutrin but it seemed to be losing its effect.  The doctor recommended adding another antidepressant to boost the Wellbutrin.  I attempted three other anti-depressants but had severe side effects. Zoloft, Lexapro, and Celexa all caused me to have severe diarrhea.  During the four weeks that I stayed with Zoloft I experienced little improvement and lost 15 pounds as a result of the diarrhea and lack of appetite.",high
zyprexa,1,"zyprexa bipolar disorder type ii - While taking Zyprexa, I never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany Bipolar Type II; however, I attribute this mostly to the fact that Zyprexa is very sedating. It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder. Increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  I am not exaggerating when I say my appetite was almost insatiable. Excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  It also made me feel almost ""numb"" emotionally.  Sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over 25 pounds. My psychiatrist prescribed Zyprexa to help with the mood swings of Bipolar Disorder.  I am classified as Bipolar Type II because I do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany Bipolar Type I.  I do, however, experience hypomania (hypo meaning low) so my moods still swing from highs to the extreme lows of depression.",Low
propecia,1,"propecia hair loss - Possible slight improvements in texture. Erectile problems,Severe anxiety, panic attacks, negative thoughts, depression, brain fog. Effected not only myself, but my family. This was not me. Only took for three months. Took much longer for side effects to subside. In my opinion a dangerous drug. May not have the same effect on everyone, but these side effects seem to be common enough to be documented and taken seriously. At this point seem to be being ignored. Took once daily until side effects became unbearable.",Low
baclofen,9,"baclofen alcohol addiction - Considerable less craving for alcohol Sometimes drowsy, easily tired Treatment started in an alcohol rehabilitation clinic january 2010 in the netherlands. Baclofen is generally known as a muscle relaxation medicine often used by people who have epilepsia. Initially 3times daily a total of 60 mg, after 6 months 90 mg per day, to increase effectiveness. Should be used in combination with therapy. Patient was severe alcohol addict for over 20 years, and has not taken any alcohol since 6 months. Patient describes that his alcohol cravings have nearly disappeared.",high

frova,8,"frova migraine headache - Frova eliminated Migraine Headaches and the effect would last 24 hours. The effect was slow.  Approximately one or two hours before any significant pain relief was noticed.  Also, some nausea from the drug. As soon as a migraine was detected a Frova would be administered.  If the migraine was intercepted immediately the Frova was succesful with relieving pain and the chance of a rebound headache was slim.  If a frova was not administered immediately a maxalt was taken then two hours afterwards a frova.  This would eliminate pain for twenty four to thirty hours. On occasion a rebound headache would occur.",high
ditropan,1,"ditropan hyperhidrosis - stopped sweating, but the drying effect brought a very dry mouth and throat as well as side effect very dry thoat and eyes, dry mouth, burning sensation when urinating. the drug is not to treat hyperhidrosis, but it's its side effects that the drug was being taken for - namely the drying up for hyperhidrosis",Low
wellbutrin,7,"wellbutrin depression - I experienced less depression, increased libido plus the added benefit of decreased desire for cigarettes. I have a dry mouth and eyes. Drug has decreased effectiveness in last 5 years. Prescribed at 300 mg per day, have taken as much 450 mg per day. I like this drug because it has few side effects.",high
tenormin,8,"tenormin hypertension - Slowed heart rate, lowered blood pressure and helped eliminate head-aches that I atributed to increasing BP. I believe that I have gained weight due to taking BP medication. I feel that my metabolic rate has been affected by these meds. BP meds are taken on a daily basis, and I try to take the meds at the same time each day. I do not take these meds on a with or w/o food timetable.",high
remicade,5,"remicade colitis - Stopped bleeding and relieved some abdominal cramps. After only 3 treatments I have developed common side effects, as in dizzines which keeps me from being too active. I am always tired even though I am finally sleeping most of the night, I have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about, and I have the need to constantly unrinate. I have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and I have just started. I believe that I am also suffering from depression, but because I am a single parent I try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily. Have done 3 infusions, starting with 2 weeks after first and then 4 weeks. Now I am awaiting my 4th which will be 8 weeks. The staff have been great, from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at Bio-Advance, but the one draw back is that I have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. So why did I find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?",high
trazodone,10,"trazodone insomnia - Trazodone allows me to fall asleep within ten minutes and sleep through the night, awaking in the morning without grogginess. I have noticed no side effects. I have never needed to increase my dosage over the course of five years, and when I skip a dose, my insomnia is exactly what it was before taking trazodone, no worse. 50 mg taken with water directly before bed puts me to sleep within ten minutes or so. I wake up 7-8 hours later (unless forced to get up earlier by my alarm clock) without feeling drugged or groggy. The insomnia being treated was the kind where I was able to fall asleep after about a half hour in bed, but then I would wake up again after a couple of hours and be unable to fall back asleep. This mild, nonaddictive drug has successfully addressed the insomnia that has affected me since childhood.",high
prevacid,9,"prevacid gerd/acid reflux - I had tried EVERY over the counter product for acid reflux and none of them worked. I also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as Prevacid has. I have found that if I take it too early prior to going to bed, it's less effective. Also, there have been a few times (very few) where it hasn't worked and I have gotten acid reflux (ash taste in mouth, vomiting, pain in throat and chest)  Also, for whatever reason, there also have been times I have had to take 2 pills versus the usual 1 pill. One pill once a day. The ingredients are supposed to limit or decrease acid reflux.",high
paxil,10,"paxil depression - The patient's was able to see positive effects in 2 weeks time.  She noted an improvement in mood, spouse noted a reduction in symptoms relating to prementrual syndrome, and a return of normal sleep patterns.  Overall return of positive mood and enjoyment of previous activities. Patient was taking the medication in the morning.  At night, a jittery restless feeling was noted which required the patient to get out of bed and move around for about 20 minutes before returning to bed.  The patient switched medication times to the evening before bed and the restlessness did not return.  The patient also noted that the desire to consume sweets or carbohydrates was markedly reduced during treatment. Treatment was easy to administer, being only once a day, and could be altered easily (am or pm).  There were no cardiovascular side effects, no dizziness, blurred vision, or nausea associated with treatment with 10 mg. paroxetine.  The mild side effects such as reduced craving for carbohydrates and feeling full earlier during a meal were not considered problematic.  The patient's clinical signs of depression, which were insomnia, and reduced enjoyment of former hobbies were reversed within a short period of time (2-3 weeks).",high
ultram,9,"ultram tempromandibular joint dysfunction (tmj) - Taking Tramadol has resulted in the effective management of chronic pain due to severe TMJ. The side effects of taking Tramadol for 11 years is addiction.  If I miss a dose, I experience typical withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache, restless leg syndrome, stomach cramps). Tramadol was prescribed after suffering from TMJ for over 20 years. I suffered from chronic pain due to severe TMJ complications.  In addition, the TMJ was causing migraine headaches and insomnia.  After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success, I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.  Finally, as a last resort, I met with a doctor who specialized in chronic pain management and I was prescribed Tramadol, 100 mg/twice daily.  This drug has worked extremely well for the past 11 years in controlling the pain.",high
wellbutrin-xl,10,wellbutrin-xl depression - The drug caused the depression to recede to the point that I was able to function normally. The libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (SSRI) were alleviated completely. I was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other SSRI Occasionally I would have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep if I took the drug too late in the day. I began to take it upon wakening daily to counter those effects. I took one tablet per day 300 mg of the Wellbutrin XL.,high
allegra-d,8,"allegra-d allergies - Decongestion, elimination of sinus pressure and tearing of eyes Jittery feeling, sleeplessness and on occasion nausea.  This medication always makes me nauseas if I take it with other vitamins or other medication such as Advil. I switched from 12 hour to 24 hour however feel that the 12 hour tablet met my needs better than the 24 hour tablet.  The 24 hour tablet seemed to run out of steam and during the heavy allergy season, my syptoms would reappear.",high
tri-luma,5,"tri-luma hyperpigmentation - Mild lightening of age and sun spots. Slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. Increased sun sensitivity. Started using the cream every other night and increased it to every night. It somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. I also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. I used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. Just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. The spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 
I would say I saw a 25% improvement in the sun spots on my face.  I have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 
I did not have much irritation when I started using this product but I had been using Retin A before I started the Tri Luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. I did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when I used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.
Also, was told it would help reduce acne and breakouts.  It did not which is disappointing. 
I use 50+ sunscreen every day and stay out of direct sunlight.",high
metformin,9,"metformin metabolic disorder - Weight loss of over 10 pounds in 4 months, continuing weight loss at a gradual rate (need to lose 40 pounds total).  Complete curbing of sugar and carbohydrate cravings, increased appetite control, cessation of binge eating patterns. Diarreha if I eat more sugar than I should, some abdominal cramping, again, only if I ate something I shouldn't have. Began at 500 mg once daily, increased to 500 mg twice daily, then increased to 2000 mg (1000 mg twice daily).  I believe that the slow increase of the dosage helped control any negative side effects.  It took about 3 months to really start noticing a difference, but that could be due to the titrating schedule.  I am also trying to be more conscious of what I do eat and when, which is helping with the weight loss and appetite issues.",high
panixine-disperdose,9,"panixine-disperdose sinus infection - The treatment benefits were that the cephalexin relieved the sinus infection around the 4th day and by the seventh day my sinuses felt better. The cephalexin seemed relatively mild as I did not experience any intestinal discomfort, bloating or cramping that I have experienced with other antibiotics. I developed vaginitis and a yeast infection. This usually starts to occur around four or five days after I finish a round of antibiotics. This reaction to antibiotics first started to occur around ten years ago after I was treated with tetracycline for six months for a severe case of lyme's disease. I had a sinus infection and was instructed to take 500mg. of cephalexin every 6 hours for seven days. It took four days before the cephalexin took effect. I have a hard time getting an antibiotic that I don't have a negative reacton to. I am allergic to penecilan and can't take Z-pack because it severely upsets my intestinal tract.",high
flonase,10,"flonase allergies - This spray clears the nasal passages to promote free breathing. I've tried over the counter remedies but they are harsh and you end up practically addicted to them. This works much the same way but is non-addictive and need only be used when symptoms hit. I have used this same product when I've had a head cold and achieved the same results. I'm pretty sure that's not what it's intended for but whenever I've got sinus pressure, I take this product. I've experienced no side effects. Simply shake the bottle, and use 2 sprays in each nostril daily.",high
tenormin,10,"tenormin high blood pressure - my blood pressure stayed in the normal range. the headaches I was having from hypertension subsided. i had no side effects i developed high blood pressure triggered, i feel, by stress from a divorce and possibly from hormone imbalance from stress due to the divorce and its ramifications. i would have headaches everyday and was checking my blood pressure while i was having a headache and at times when i did not have a headache. it was most definitely elevating during a headache. i tried one other medication first with no success. my Dr. switched me to atenolol with good results.

Minor bruising and longer bleeding times with cuts, but nothing serious. Occasional dizziness when the INR counts went above 3 or 4. It's difficult at times to get a stable INR reading due to all the various foods, supplements, and drugs which either increase or decrease Coumadin's effects. Prescribed Coumadin after DVT and PE stay (with IV heparin first) for six months. Weekly blood tests until INR levels stabilized, then biweekly. One 5 mg pill taken daily with warnings to watch food, drug and supplement intake.",high
claritin,8,"claritin irritated and sore throat,nose,eyes and sneezing. - I suffered swollen and extremely sore throats with lots of mucus gathering up at the back of my throat. Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped. The drowsiness was overwhelming, I was sleeping for about 16hours a day with no relief after and my appetite increased rapidly. I was consuming about three times my usual intake. Overall, they worked but the side affects were incredibly bad.",high
ambien,3,"ambien insomnia - Fell fast asleep for the first few months, then I had to keep upping the dose and addiction set in. I had a horrible time with withdrawal symtoms.

zegerid,6,"zegerid reflux - Acid in the stomach was reduced so that the reflux was kept under control.  Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus. Constipation and even less chance of digesting food properly. Even though the reflux was kept under control I felt that constipation and poor digestion was a bad trade-off.  As there is bowel cancer in the family clearing of the large intestine is important to me.  I have now stopped taking the drug and prefer to treat the reflux by taking care of what I eat, how and when I eat, and being careful not to bend over too much after food.

xyrem,9,"xyrem narcolepsy - Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me. Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem. 1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later.",high
lamictal,10,"lamictal bipolar disorder - Lamictal is by far the best medicine that I have been perscribed. It almost has completly controlled my depression which was very severe, and has almost completly controled my mania. I still get slightly hypomanic, but this has not been a problem for me. I originally took Lamictal 200mg once a day for two months in March 2008 and had to stop because of moderate memory loss(mild long term loss and  moderate/severe short term loss), loss of ballence, and fatigue.I was sometimes in a mental fog. I would repeat the same things several times an hour and not remeber that I had said it. When I first started taking Lamictal I was leaving for college in a few months and my doctor(whom I no longer see)rushed me to raise my perscription very quickly.During that time it had completly controled my depression and mania. I am currently taking it, and started taking it again in September 2009. I now take 150mg once a day. I have not had any side effects since I started taking it again in september.I partially believe that the reason it is so effective now is that I am 20 lbs heavier than I was when I first took Lamictal and because I now take a lower dose.",high
ketoconazole,8,ketoconazole ringworm/pityriasis - The skin rash was better I can not be sure it was from the medication but I had mild stomach upset I originally had lamisil cream to treat a  pretty bad case of ringworm.  After about 4 days the rash was spreading and so I went back and received oral Lamisil. I took that for 14 days and the rash was lighter but still there. The doctor then prescribed Ketoconazole and after 3 days the rash was significantly lighter. By the end of the prescription the rash was almost completely gone.,high

The doctor prescribed first losec but nexium appears to be less costy and with the same benifit. Nexium worked the whole dayand i had less acidity feeling at night. But my condition went worse and i did funduplication surgery and now i dont need it,high
cosopt,9,"cosopt high interoccular pressure - Cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. The treatment benefits are long term. Reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. Sorry not 50 words. I suspect it caused increased hair loss (thining) which I became aware of after about two - two and a half years of using the medication. I had hair loss before ever starting medications but it seems like this medicine began increasing the problem. Cosopt burned initially on application and turned the eyes red which cleared up fairly quickly. I am not aware of any other side effect. I switched medications and further explanation is below. If I knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes. I had elevated occular pressure that needed to be reduced and my doctor put me on xalatan which caused my eyelashes to begin to thicken and become dark in a couple of months so I had him put me on something else so we went to cosopt. After a time I felt like this was causing increased hair loss so I looked up drug side effects and cosopt was listed as causing hair loss so I had him change it again then I started alphagan p and azopt. My eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol 0.25 percent. The redness quickly went away. Now with azopt in each eye once in the morning and once at bedtime and timilol 0.25 in both in the mornings only my occular pressures have been reduced one to two points lower in each eye than what the cosopt did when taken in the morning and at bedtime. These changes have not stopped the hair loss from occuring even though timilol 0.25 percent has half the timilol in it as the cosopt and is used only once a day in each eye vs cosopts twice a day in each eye. Azopt is reported to cause hair loss and is very similar to the second ingredient in cosopt.",high
zovirax,7,zovirax herpes - WORKED EXTREMELY WELL AT PREVENTING OUT BREAKS. an out break would come on and id start taking it and it would be gone withing 48 hours if i took it properly. massive amount of hair loss. I basically went from a full head of hair to half bald in a span of 3 years.Also arthritis type pain between joints if you take too much for too long. Sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. This stuff has some serious side effects. Men feel the side effects much worse then woman do. make sure your doctor prescribes you 800 mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. Its like the same price as the 200 mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.,high

arava,9,"arava rheumatoid arthritis - I added this medication 8 months after I began monthly infusions of Orencia. Orencia alone gave mild improvement in symptoms of severe rheumatoid arthritis. (I had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms. When I resumed the 20mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about 6-8 weeks. I have some GI distress, but am not sure if it's directly due to Leflunomide or to a long history of taking RA medications which also negative have GI effects.

I had a very serious eye infection last year which resulted in corneal scarring and loss of much vision in one eye. It's very possible that my immune-suppressed condition (Leflunomide and Orencia)resulted in a more serious infection and slower healing time than if I were not on immunosuppressants.

(I look like a raccoon.)  It burns my face - especially around my eyes - when I use any moisturizer or sunscreen. I had to switch to a milder cleanser to reduce irritation. My dermatologist prescribed this with a water pill and some kind of anti-bacteria medicine to treat my acne.  I have been on Yaz for a year and it has not helped my acne at all. All over the counter medicines have been ineffective.  I mostly break out around my period and I only get pimples where I have hair folicles.,high

The most noticeable and bothersome side effect (constipation) began after about 9 days of treatment. After putting up with it for a week I went to my doctor.

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from

If you are stuck behind a desk.. turn from side to side... do stretches.. then at lunch or break move!!! There are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. Exercise is the magical word.
So get up and move it. walk.. dance.. or you will be stuck at the same weight. It takes work.. and a lot of it. It amazes me how there are those expecting a miracle in a pill. Not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal jittery.. sometimes euphoric.. tired but cant sleep.. in a zone. last results 3 months on adipex-p lost 30 pounds. Gained it back due to injury at work. Currently on day 5 and working out with the nintedo wii and walking. if I am sitting I am not doing so still .. i do leg lifts .. twist my hips practice good breathing patterns for everyday health. Its really beneficial to breath correctly. I am on a very low calorie intake diet. I eat 1200 to 1500 a day and it is not skipping a meal to eat ice cream.. no fat diet veggies.. fresh fruit and chicken . palm sized servings for everything.. extra no butter, fat, oils,
processed meats, dairy is low fat or fat free yogurt. Daily vitamin and lots and lots of water to replenish so you don't get fatigued.  Im on my way.. 5 pounds down and 25 to go. Good luck this can work for most people with no excuses other then a underlying disease .. if so its obvious you shouldn't be taking adipex. Good luck all .. dont get weak. and if you mess up make sure its worth it.. that extra serving dont let it be more then a half cup and only if you can burn it off. Good Luck all and remember don't give up.. don't cheat yourself with extra licks from the brownie bowl.. tasting samples of dinner before serving. those are huge calories not counted for that can ruin your diet.

Because it only took away part of the pain I thought it would be OK to take 2 more tablets.  That was a really bad idea.  I started to feel pressure in my head, I felt like I was going to faint, my lips started to tingle.  The worst effect though was that about 3 min after my heart started going extremely fast then started skipping over and over.  It was very scary.

The chronic diarrhea began in 07/2009 before I started taking Pravastatin and lab testing has not revealed any cause for it. After taking Pravastatin for 60 days lab tests were performed to test liver function and cholesterol levels. After reviewing the test results I was told to continue taking Pravastatin for another 30 days and then get lab testing done again.

After a hospital stay, being treated with IV Solumedrol, for 5 days, and many blood tests etc, my blood work came up with a very elevated ACE level, the doctors now suspect Sarcoidosis, the Neuro put me on 60 MG prednisone daily for 90 days, and in the meantime see the Rheumatoid doc to rule out this condition, the prednisone unfortunately that i am on, makes it very difficult to diagnose, and he wants me to start a taper, to see what happens, and then they can start doing more tests, as Prednisone masks the inflammation that they are looking for 

They also did a bone density test while there, and have discovered i have severe osteoporosis, so really not sure if they are going to get me off this drug pretty fast 

The drug is dangerous to be on and can cause other problems, but my Neuro obviously feels the need to have me on it sure i am scared to be on too long, but i think right now the benefits out weigh the risks",high

I haven't had any more anxiety attacks and Lexapro has helped me. I did not personally have any side effects from taking Lexapro. I gained 5lbs after starting it, but it was also winter time and I seem to gain 5 pounds around the holidays anyway. No trouble taking it off in the spring so I don't think it was an actual side effect--just too much of the holiday food. I had never had a panic or anxiety attack before.

Walking an 18 hole golf course can be painful for me, even after a year post surgery, I was in search of pain relief to continue playing a sport I love. Celebrex reduced my inflammation and stiffness and allowed me to play pain free. So far I have experienced no side effects. I have had no bad or serious reactions. I have not had any intestinal pains, diarhhea or nausea that I have heard are common side effects that are associated with taking this drug. I have not even had an upset stomach. I have been taking Celebrex now for over five months. I am very pleased with the drug it has helped to relieve my stiffness and pain with no bad side effects. I was concerned about taking this drug on a daily basis or extended term but my experience with no side effects has lowered my concern. I will continue to take it as I do see a difference when I don't, my knee is more stiff and difficult to walk at times. I have tried naproxen but for me celebrex works better.",high

While I was taking Claritin for about a year, it wasn;t having any effect on these allergies. When I first started taking it, I would get drowsy.  I started splitting the pill in half and taking them about 12 hours apart and this seemed to help.  Also I noticed a drastic decrease in alcohol tolerance.

I was always forgetful, but now after taking it a few days, I nearly never forget anything. And I remember the material covered in class. Few side effects, BUT...the few that I did have were quite severe. The biggest and worst effect was the constant chewing, mostly without noticing. As I said before, I'm spontaneous. And my spontaneous self had decided to buy a pacifier shortly before my doctors appointment where I was prescribed Vyvanse. After taking the vyvanse,I felt the sudden urge to chew, on anything ane everything, including the pacifier, my fingers, my cell phone, and the worst, my cheeks. I could feel the pain of chewing my cheeks, and I could taste the blood, but I didn't know what caused it. I didn't know that I was chewing my cheeks at that point. By the end of that day, I had chewed both cheeks, my tongue, and the right side of my top lip quite badly. It also made me lose all intrest in eating, and I love to eat, and I need to eat. (85 lbs. 5'1"") after school, I knew that I had to eat, and spent over 30 minutes eating a single cookie. On 9/18/11 I was prescribed (30) 30mg Vyvanse for ADHD to take every morning. It had common side effects on me, such as loss of appetite, severe chewing, and I ""geeked out"" pretty bad.

I was taking Imitrex at the initial sign of a migrain (eye aura) but this was had limited effectiveness. My doctor recommended trying Topamax. In the first 2 months I had 2 migrains and have only had 4 in the last 18 months. I take 100mg at bed because it makes very relaxed and sleep very deeply.

At the very least, the symptoms of glucoma immediately improved to normal and have remained at the normal range. Longer eye lashes, darker eyes, slight eye irritation. I have been very satisfied with the results of taking lumigan. My eye pressure was in the mid 20's and has dropped to the mid teen's. As an experiment, I stopped taking lumigan for several months and my pressure went back up over 20, so I went back on lumigan and it again dropped to the mid teen's.

I was prescribed glasses, had to have extensive testing and FINALLY after 3-1/2 weeks, my normal vision return. I contacted the pharmacy, the drug manufacturer, the FDA and a toxicologist and none were able to tell me how long the side effects would last. I am grateful to have my sight back but this drug should not be on the market if even only 1& of the population can have visual disturbances...It was hell to not see clearly and have to submit to so many tests and be so dependent on others for getting around.

seasonique,9,"seasonique birth control - Very effective at preventing pregnancy.  Also regulated menstrual cycle length and helped relieve acne.  The best part is that you only menstruate 4 times a year, as opposed to 12 or 13. During the first two months or so that I was on Seasonique, I experienced rather severe depression and uncontrollable mood swings.  I also had issues with breast swelling and tenderness.  I spoke with my doctor and he advised me that such side effects, although very uncommon, almost always wore off after the first few months.  I decided to stick it out and sure enough, they wore off as my body grew accustomed to the medication. You take one pill every day, preferably at around the same time.",high

Getting on a correct dose of thyroid replacement is great.  My hair returned, I became more fit and active. When on too much levothyroxine I was jittery, had weight loss and was emotional.  If I had too little I had difficulty with bloating and fatigue.  It was certainly a drug that had to be monitored and adjusted based on lab levels and side effects. I began replacement with 250mcg each day.  I rather quickly had difficulty with rapid heart rate, dry hair and skin, emotionalness that wasn't true to me.  It took several months of monitoring blood levels of thyroid hormone, monitoring syptoms and adjusting doses to find a right dose for me.  I've been stable on my current dose for 3 years.",high

However, just reading about other people's anxiety accounts and Xanax has given me anxiety! A wee lethargic, but welcome feeling compared to... you know dying and hyperventilating. :) Definately tired. Maybe some minor bowel disturbances.

I went to this dermatologist and he said that what could be causing my acne is the hormones balance, (if you have too much feminine or masculine hormones it can cause acne)so he said i could try to take birth control pill to balance my hormones. and so i started. In the first month my acne got worse,but i still kept taking Yasmin(birth control pill), on the third month i started noticing that my skin was clearing from all those pimples.I have been taking it for more than 6 months now and i have no acne! sometimes one or two comes out but it goes away in 2 days.So Yasmin worked for me and could work for you too!

Rest is a must while taking this medication.  Its better if you do not drive and perform intensive activities right after taking this medication.  It is a very strong medication and since I have a petite physique, I did think that the dose was a bit too high for me.  I felt very light headed and drowsy after taking th epill but i must say the pill does do its job. The pill was prescribed to me for recovering from pain after my wisdom teeth were extracted.  It was a very effective pain killer.  All of my wisdom teeth were extracted the same day and I was in excruciating pain once the anesthetic wore off.

Now I sleep like a baby. Very effective. Taken as prescribed there are no problems. A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great. I take the .5 mg fast acting version, not the long acting version.

topamax,10,"topamax epilepsy - I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome. In the beginning I remember getting ""topatingles"" or tingling in my fingers (that hurt sometimes), toes, and even my lips. I lost a lot of weight and have stayed in the underweight category ever since. My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!

All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish. 

I still have dilantin side effects which are easy to distinguish as I've been on that since 1985, but the topamax ones are gone barring once and awhile I have a bit of 'loss of words' while speaking. I love this drug. I take one 200mg tab in the morning and one 200mg tab in the evening. I take the brand name topamax as the generic one caused my blood levels to dive a bit and I had a breakthrough seizure. Too bad as the generic is much cheaper.",high
effexor,7,"effexor depression - helped the depression initially, was far more positive during the years I took it, but the efficacy of the drug began to deteriate, and the onset of new side effects led me to try to live without the treatment initially, not many, some loss of concentration when driving longer than half hour periods, eyes felt very heavy, and it felt like part of my brain had shut down, struggled not to fall to sleep. after some time, about six years, I started to get night sweats, very uncomfortable, and mood swings. I thought it might be hormaonal, but after taking away the drug , the symptoms alleviated. I now feel that I have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time, and part of the reason I was depressd was I found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time, I had two very young children , and was not diagnosed with a condition . If I had understood my condition better, I may have managed the fibromyalgia better. I was pushing my body too hard, as I felt frustrated t not managing everything better, and the cycle of depression continued. I have come off the venlafaxine, and the symptoms of pain, particularly in the morning have returned, but I can manage them better, knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition, and that it is 'normal' for me. I pace myself better, and no longer have the demands of very young children , so can do that easier. I like being 'drug' free, although I do supplement with fish oils and 5 HTP",high

niaspan,8,"niaspan cholesterol problems - My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with, as the doctor said, ""the cholesterol of a 40 year old man.""  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)! Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy, and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed, and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep, but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided, and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up. I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then, after I moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.  My liver stats were being monitored because of another medication I was taking (mercaptopurine), so I'm relatively sure I haven't had any adverse liver effects with this drug.",high
baclofen,9,"baclofen muscle pain and stiffness due to fibromyalgia - Significant reduction in cramping, stiffness, and ""knots"" in muscles.

When I first began taking the medication, I slept ALL the time--as much as 22 hours a day.  I literally could not stay awake.  This may have been due not only to the drug's sedating affect, but to the vast sleep deficit of that years of pain and insomnia had produced.  As time went on, I slept less, and was less dependent on the Baclofen as a ""maintenance"" medication--I began to ""save"" it to take in slightly more concentrated doses when a severe muscle spasm or strain, or a ""flare"" occurs, which happens frequently in fibromyalgia patients.

tri-luma,3,"tri-luma melasma - My melasma improved considerably, which speaks to the efficacy of the treament because I only used it for 7 days. My skin started flaking all over my face (not just on the application sites). The flaking is similar to normal dry skin symptoms. I also developed very minor scabby areas below my eyes, just above the cheek application site. The corners of my mouth turned red and became irritated, which was annoying and unbecoming. I basically bought Tri Luma to treat a cosmetic issue. It helped relieve the problem a bit, but it created additionaly cosmetic problems. I am more embarrassed by the redness at my mouth than I am by the discoloration...actually, I don't know which is worse.

copaxone,9,"copaxone mulitple sclerosis - No exacerbations since starting during summer of 2008 after 11 years on Avonex (another ""disease modifying medications"" for MS. Redness, itching, sometimes swelling at injection site and mild soreness.  All are brief in duration. I have never experienced the flushing described by ""49 year old female"" either, but Shared Solutions will inform you about it so you will be prepared should it happen.

I like to consider it in the same way I did Avonex for all those years; it sucks, but it keeps me on my toes and therefore worth it. Very simple once you establish a simple routine.  ""Shared Solutions"", the company behind Copaxone provides you with everything you need for each injection, including; in home injection training, which I was able to get down with just one session, but they will come as often as you need.

You load an injection tool with a syringe.  Remove the cap from the syringe (simple).  Wipe the inection site with a kind of cheap, provided alcohol wipe.  Let the alcohol dry (30-60) seconds.  Place the tip of the tool on the injection site, press a button and the tool injects the shot in about 7-15 seconds.  It varies.  Yeah, I called them cheap alcohol wipes, but they are good enough and I'm picky.  I buy my own because they are inexpensive.

Most important as stated earlier by ""49 year old female"" rotate the injection sites.  Rotate, Rotate, Rotate.  No tissue damage for me so far from Copaxone, but minor damage from Avonex on leg.  Rotate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Shared Solutions offers great support via the phone or website.

My nighmares felt so real that I almost stopped taking the medication. After about two day the nightmare just turned into very vivid dreams... sometimes very pleasant dreams. Seroquel also makes me urinate more often so I drink more water to stay hydrated. I was diagnosed with PTSD after several negative incidents happened in my life. There was a point when I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin. The doctor started me on Seroquel... a very high dose at first, 300mg.

After one week of enduring the loss of my sense of taste and smell, I stopped taking the medication.  It's only been 2 days and these two senses have not yet returned, but I'm hopeful they will eventually. I contacted my pharmacist and she researched the Terbinafine I was taking and told me it could very well be what was causing this problem.  Since I had no idea what else it could be, I stopped taking it on my own.  I then contaced my physician and gave her the details and she agreed that stopping it would be wise at this point.  We are hoping that this is what the problem is and that my sense of taste and smell will return.  We just don't know when it will happen.  Very unpleasant experience, I must say.",Low

The evening pill did make me drousy but that is mentioned on the prescription. It a good thing because people sometimes does not sleep well when they are trying to quit or do quit smoking. It was the best treatment I could have chose. I am very satisfies with the treatment. It has worked for me. It started having an effect on me the 2nd day of treatment.

Right before I started taking xanax, I was in and out of the emergency room with heartbeats up to 200 beats per minute.  My heart doctor put me on Lanoxin and inderal to control heartbeat, and gave me Lorazopam for nerves.  The Lorazopam did not do me any good.  I was still having fast heartbeat attacks.  He then referred me to a psychiatrist who put me on Xanax.  My panic attacks stopped for the most part. I started out on .5 mg 3 times per day, and dropped down to .5 mg 1 time per day a few years later, as I was able to cope better with less.   Today, I no longer take any medications at all.

I also think I was clearer with regard to remembering events -the event itself, as well as the order in which things occurred in the particular event. Initially, I noticed no side effects. However, after taking it for approximately three weeks I began with nausea. I assumed I had caught a 'bug' & continued taking the med. Going into the fourth week the nausea became more pronounced & came intermittently throughout the day & evening. Additionally,the nausea was intermittently accompanied by a mild headache. My doctor prescribed Aricept to aid my memory difficulties following a serious car accident in which I sustained multiple injuries, including a head injury. I do not recall events correctly, nor do I recall them in proper sequence. I have great difficulty remembering things;ex: If I have something on the stove I must stay with it; if I walk away I become distracted & completely forget I have something on the stove; I forget where I put things;if I am given instructions on something, they must be written down, as I cannot recall them or recall them correctly.

I have noticed releif from the soreness and stiffness that comes with this problem. Other than that I don't know what else I can tell you about this drug. Since there are fewer drugs available for this problem that are effective it has also been shown to be safe. The only side effects of takibg this drug are some stomach irritation. I have found that if I take it with food it helps. The manufacturers of this drug claim that there are no side effects involving the stomach but I would disagree with this claim. I have been taking Celebrex for over 5 years. As it is an expensive drug I probably would not be taking it unless it werew provided free by my doctor. I notice that I feel much better when I have been taking it for a few days but because of the side effect of stomach irritation I usually have to stop taking it for a few days to let me stomach return to normal.

prozac,10,"prozac depression - this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all. initial dosage was 20 mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about 5 years, at which point it was raised to 40 mgs. each day.  ultimately, the dosage was raised again approximately 2-3 years after the first increase to my current dosage of 60 mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido. basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor, as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication.",high

The treatment WAS effective in TEMPORARILY breaking the smoking habit and possibly could have had longer lasting effects, however, my skin had a reaction to the patches (I started developing large, red, hot circles everywhere they touched my skin) and I found that I could not effectively lead my day-to-day life while under the influence of the Bupropion. Once I stopped using both products, I slowly returned to smoking.",Low
byetta,1,"byetta obesity and diabetes - I initially had severe cramping and nausea, but I continued under doctor's orders, I only lost about 20 pounds, tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years. Severe cramping, headaches, incredible nausea, muscle cramps, vomiting blood (not once but on 2 occasions due to doctor's orders).  I now am facing something wrong with my digestive tract and no doctor has been able to figure out what is wrong.  Since this is the area where the medication was injected, and only there, I believe that the byetta is the perfect suspect.  Now, if I could only find a doctor that will listen to me.  The count is 5 and still increasing.  Recently, I lost 4 pounds in 3 days!!!!  This is not normal! I was to inject the said amount into the abdominal (below the waist, above the pelvic bone) before breakfast and lunch.  The amount was changed when the medical professional I was having treat me decided to increase the dosage, and with terrible results (I was vomiting blood and could not eat or even drink water - I couldn't even stand the smell of food).  I wish I had never heard of Byetta!!!!!!",Low
zovirax,10,"zovirax skin warts on elbow - I have been plagued with peristent mutiple warts on my elbow for over 10 years. At Christmas - I decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the Summer. I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin. None - In fact it gave great relief to sore irritated skin as new 'wart' blister tried to form. 

I suggest a clinical trial to be used in conjunction with cryotherapy to prevent spread and regrowth - once warts are treated. It is certainly more successful in eliminating 'emerging warts' and preventing regrowth than the recommended salicylic acid - which does more harm then good. This may be a marketing oportunity for you as re-growth is often more of a problem than treating the original wart.",high

Irritable, sleeplessness, rages of angry, fatigue, high blood pressure My OBGYN switched me from Prozac to Wellbutrin in efforts to help with the sexual side affects.   Well, it did absolulte nothing to help in that area and instead made me more depressed, irritable, had severe rages, crying all the time, no desire to get out of bed, hot flashes and my blood pressure spiked tremendously.   I went back to my PCP and I'm back to Zoloft which I had taken in the past and although I'm still having w/d's from the Wellbutrin, I'm felling 80% better in it's only been 3 days.

These side affects have been decreasing since I discontinued the drug.  Advair seems to be fine for a short time, only to aggravate things later on. I was treated for asthma which kicked up during the winter cold season, and my doctor put me on advair and prednisone (short dose).

The smallest nuisance would set me off. I remember actually throwing something across my dining room. It was awful. At that point I decided to no longer take the drug. I am not certain what I should describe here. The treatment details were that I was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and I never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one.

It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way. I never got pregnant.

protonix,10,"protonix gerd - Within two days, the severe burning pain of the GERD disappeared. At three months of treatment, the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer, however, I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy. Shortly after starting treatment, I developed diarrhea. It only lasted for a few days, but then I continue to have somewhat pasty stools, with occasional bouts of diarrhea again. I went to the ER with severe burning in the chest. The doctors there suspected either cardiac problems or a blood clot in the lungs. Once they made certain there were no blood clots, and that the EKG and cardiac enzyme levels were normal, they started me on IV protonix. The next day I was switched to pill form of the protonix, and the improvement was amazing. Within thirty-six hours the pain was minimal, and by the third day of treatment, it was virtually gone. Since then, I haven't had any recurrence, and remain on the protonix only because of the ulcer, which is improving, even though at a slower pace. Overall, it's an excellent medication, and had worked wonders for me.",high

On 50 mg the first few days, I awoke with horrible facial and jaw pain; I also had some congestion. After going down to 25mg, the facial pain ceased, but I began having nightmares and after the day of elation, I was depressed the day following. I am currently wondering whether these effects will subside and the benefits increase. Doctor started me on one pill for 3 days,then double for the next and 3 pills upt 150 mg. on the 7th day.

I had no side effects, other than a little soreness after the operation, nothing went wrong, and my sex life actually improved, mainly because there was no more pain down there. after the operation i relaxed for three weeks no heavy lifting, took premarin, still take premarin, so at the age of 47 still have not had the side effects of menopause, which is nice,  they say there are risk at a later age and how long you've been on them, but am confident enough and quite healthy at this time.",high

When I had to go off the Effexor XR due to cost, the depression recurred.  This drug literally changed my life.

warfarin,6,"warfarin heart condition - Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment. The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me? Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?  Who determined how much blood you can give anyway?",high

Then when I noticed the old symptoms of mild depression, tiredness, sugar cravings etc., I went back on.  I found that the natural form of Armour allowed my thyroid to kickstart.  After talking to many people who have used the synthetic form, they didn't experience this.  Their thyroid seemed to shut down and they had to always take the drug. None I started out at 1/4 grain every other day.  Gradually I increased that to every day.  Then I would take 1/2 grain every other day.

rifadin,8,"rifadin mrsa abcess - The abcess and inflammation around the area disappeared. It is very important that MRSA abcesses be treated immediately. If you have a history of MRSA, get to your doctor and begin medication as quickly as possible. Rifmapin is a very effective drug for MRSA infections. The doctor will do a workup of all the effective medications against your specific MRSA infection and choose the appropriate antibiotic. There were no side effects that I encountered. The drug must be taken on an empty stomach, which is not the case for many other antibiotics. If the drug is not taken on an empty stomach, its effects will be diluded and the drug will be less potent against the infection. It is always recommended to follow the instructions for any drug very closely, and as for rifampin, take it on an empty stomach. Rifampin is a drug used for MRSA infections. It is important that for any abcess that presents, for the doctor to take a culture of the bacteria and send it to the lab. Some abcesses are not MRSA infections, and others may be MRSA infections.

lyrica,10,"lyrica fibromyalgia - Lyrica has made a huge difference with my fibromyalgia pain. I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication, along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure, but I have improved probably 75% over this last year. It took my body 3-4 weeks to get used to Lyrica.  It did make me feel a little different ""high"" would probably be the best way to describe it.  I have since adjusted and have had no further side effects. Started with 50 mg 2x a day (morning and afternoon), then gradually built up to 150mg 2x a day.",high

To sleep was good, but morning psychedelic effect no good. I sincerely doubt that the mirt would have been manageable without adjunctive benzodiazapine therapy and i wonder if the overall treatment out come would not have been better with benzo monotherapy as i presented with anxiety and insomnia and the M caused anxiety.

I was also relieved that I had very little lasting nerve pain afterwards None except for exhaustino from disrupted sleep pattern due to needing to take the medication every 4-5 hours as above - I was prescribed this medication for severe shingles, which went from my calf up to my lower back on my left side.  They covered the left lower side of my body extensively.  Treatment occured late due to many doctor's reluctance to treat me whilst i was breastfeeding.

I began my therapy, set a quit date for one week later.  I followed the instructions and noticed at approximately day three, that my cravings had eased somewhat.  In the days that followed, the payoff I usually recieved from the nicotine no longer had the same effect.

proquin-xr,10,"proquin-xr urinary tract infrection - No diarrhea and better drug efficacy. None at all.  The person who previously reviewed had an allergic reaction.  That does NOT mean the drug doesn't work, that means she simply can't tolerate the medication. My father is in a wheelchair.  For those of you with handicapped family and friends, you know how difficult urinary tract infections can be.  Ciprofloxin was a major break through for UTI's.  Unfortunately, paralyzed men and women have trouble holding their bowel movements due to the ""dumping"" effect of cipro releasing directly into the gut.  Although not widely promoted just know that Proquin XR has truly changed my father's life.  Instead of being hospitalized once a year due to a UTI, he can now take Proquin XR and continue on with his normal daily life/work etc.  Proquin XR basically allows the body to metabolize more of the medication and this in turn makes the medication more efficacious.  In layman's terms, it works faster and more effectively.  If you have digestive issues due to cipro or any antibiotic, you seriously need to try this medication.  It has not only helped my father but has made my family's life much easier.",high

lexapro,9,"lexapro depression & anxiety - Immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. Also, I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming Lexapro, I experienced results in 2-3 days. In the beginning, I felt a little dazed and disoriented for the first 1-2 weeks of taking Lexapro. Once my body adjusted to the drug, I felt like it took the edge off irritability and made me feel like my old self. Sustaining side effects were sexual; a decrease in ability to orgasim. 10 mg of Lexapro was prescribed to be taken 1x daily. I was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of 4-6 weeks.",high
effexor,9,"effexor depression - I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a ""cure"". 
Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference. As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time. I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission.",high

prednisone,3,"prednisone severe recurrent sinus infections - I was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic I was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  The prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost. Sleeplessness!  Taking the prednisone was like drinking ten cups of coffee every night or like being on speed.  I had unnatural amounts of energy -- nervous energy -- and wore myself out during the time I was taking the prednisone.  It always helped to clear up the infection, but then I had to recover from the prednisone.  This is a scary drug. In addition to whatever antibiotic I was currently on, I was to take 9 mg. of prednisone -- the first few times, it was 3 mg with each meal, but that was really too much, so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days, sometimes as few as 7, sometimes as many as 15.  Then, I had to taper off the amount I took for several days, in 3 mg increments for a few days each new dose.  Finally, I would be off it.  This time.",Low

After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again.

Overall fatigue was also minimized. The day after the injection I was extremely worn out.  Almost like having the flu.  I took the shot on Friday nights, went to bed around 11pm, and then wasn't able to get up before noon the next day, simply due to severe fatigue.

None. The drug was started within 24 hours of first symptoms. Following the advice on the packet the tablets were always taken with food ( single serve cheese and crackers ) and some gatorade. I was careful to maintain hydration with Gatorade brand drink. First dose was late afternoon so set alarm clock to wake at 3 am for next dose rather than waiting till i woke up naturally which given my tired state may well have missed a dose then pushed each dose back by 2-3 hours until they were being taken at times more agreable to the bodyclock.

Also went to see a Dr. 2 days later and was given a prednisone pack because I had chest congestion and by that time I had laryngitis plus shortness of breath.  I dealt with these symptoms for 2 weeks.  Cough and wheezing got better and then I realized the connection between getting all of these symptoms and the side effects.

zoloft,4,"zoloft depression - While I definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, I believe that Zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone. From my personal experience, this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. I had become a zombie, not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. My emotions had been totally flattened. My libido was gone. I had absolutely no desire for any kind of sexual activity. 50 mg per day, in the mornings. Total duration of the treatment: 3 years.
During the treatment course, attempts were made to titrate the dosage to 100 mg per day, but I couldn`t tolerate it.",Low
minocycline,1,"minocycline acne - I originally took the medication in a smaller dose for 3-4 months and saw a reduction of pus-filled pimples. The physician increased the dose to hopefully increase the benefits, as I still had significant acne. After taking this medication for 1 week, I experienced sudden severe joint pain and stiffness, almost like very bad arthritis. I was 30 years old at the time. I took this medication as prescribed by a dermatologist for 1 week at the 100 mg dose before severe side effects started. Side effects disappeared by 3 days after discontinuation.",Low
prempro,10,"prempro hot flashes, depression - Within two weeks I found the hot flashes had subsided.  After 4 weeks I no longer had night sweats.  It took 3 or 4 months for my depression to get better.  The release from depression was tremendous and such a relief. I could not notice any side effects.  I did not even gain weight. I take these religiously every day.  The prescription was written by my primary care provider (a female) and even thought much younger than me, she understood immediately my primary concern was the depression; even though the hot flashes and night sweats were uncomfortable.",high
prilosec,3,"prilosec acid reflux - Reduction of acid. Side effects from 20mg per day after one year of use were those listed in over-dose of prilosec side effects; along with other side effects not listed.

N/A this is being written by a patient, not a physician.",high
imuran,7,"imuran lupus - The treatment reduced the symptoms of SLE that I was suffering from: these were pain and inflammation in my wrists, hands and fingers.  It also reduced some puffiness in my face - perhaps b/c I had inflammation in my jaw joint. I did not notice changes in my hair or skin, but I believe that this drug might increase my fatigue somewhat.  I believe this b/c when I went to a higher dose (25 to 50 mg) I needed more rest.

I have gained some weight, but am unsure if this is a side-effect of Imuran or of lifestyle changes due to less physical activity.  (I suspect it is the latter) 1 year at 25 mg

avita,3,"avita wrinkles - There were no treatment benefits--See below--I hoped to begin to see some effects after several months but because I had so much difficulty with it I gave up. My skin became so irritated and red that I stopped using it.  I was using just a small amount and still had trouble with irritation and small, watery itchy bumps appearing, primarily around my nose and mouth.  The prescription strength was probably too high and because it was purchased in Mexico it also may not have been from a trustworthy source. I had used Differin in the past with good results but was considerably younger then--in this last round I tried it hoping to reduce wrinkles but couldn't proceed with using it due to irritation etc.",Low

The overall effect has been most agreeable including a loss of over 100 pounds of body fat. Mild nausea if you didn't eat within one hour of use, otherwise there were no side effects noted.

nuvaring,3,"nuvaring birth control - It was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day, you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks. I noticed that I felt really down around month two of taking in, my mood swings were severe, I felt tired ALL THE TIME. I could also feel the ring during sex and it frequently came out during sex. ALthough it is convenient, it almost defeats the purpose of birth control if you have to worry all the time that the ring is going to come out. also, mood swings and feelings of tiredness were almost unbearable. would not recommend it.",Low

I entered a hospuital six years ago for suicidality; I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating (I had anorexia nervosa), and I was extremely depressed. I started taking 10mg of Zyprexa the first night I was there. I was really drowsy all the next day, but it waned over a few days (now it doesn't affect my energy level at all.)

My breakout were more frequent and severe when I first began this treatment. Also the cream itself was a little to heavy, it may work better for those with dry skin. I did not notice increased sun sensitivity or significant dryness. I would have preferred this treatment if it was a gel or a light lotion, and not a heavy cream.

This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further. Treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  I had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  This never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  The two items that were noted is that I was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using Renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  I also did find, as stated, that I would burn much more easily in the sun. My skin care program prior to Renova was wash with Cetaphil, tone with a Paula Begoun antioxidant toner, 8% glycolic acid gel, moisturizer.  Same in the evening.  After adding Renova, same routine in morning but in evening I went to:  Wash with Cetaplil, tone with same product as before, wait 30 minutes, apply Renova.  On alternate nights, I add a Skin Recovery Antioxidant about 30 minutes after the Renova.",high
lexapro,10,"lexapro panic attacks - I have no more panic attacks, it helped to reduce anxiety, to improve the mood. I feel the old myself again and can function well at work.Sometimes I still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. I highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs. None, the only disadvantage was it started working after 2 weeks of usage. The treatment is supposed to last 1-1.5 years",high
lexapro,10,"lexapro anxiety - Before taking Lexapro, I had constant anxiety.  I wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but I was having them one in awhile.  My anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  I was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  Once I started taking Lexapro, that all changed.  It did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms I experience now.  I am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  I know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success. I have never experienced any side effects.  I take it every morning and it's like taking an asprin...you don't notice any type of change.  If I miss my dose a few days in a row, I notice my behavior changes and I get moody and worry-some, but it takes a few days to experience that. I have taken 10 mg a day, every day, for the last 3 years.  It took a few weeks for the medicine to take effect (about 2) and the chance was gradual, but one day i woke up and noticed that I felt normal.  It has been wonderful for me and I am very thankful I have access to it.",high
delestrogen,10,"delestrogen menopause/hysterectomy - Significantly reduced symptoms of menopause, including eliminated all hot flashes (as long as the drug is being taken), reduces skin dryness that occurred after hysterectomy, and preserved sex drive. 
preserve sex drive I am not aware of any side effects from this drug, I did not experience any. Doctor told me I could take as little as 1/4 tablet per day if I wanted. I take one per day and I am very happy with the results. If I accidentally skip one day, I know fairly soon that I have missed it because I get chills or start to have hot flashes.",high
atenolol,10,"atenolol mitral  valve prolapse - My heart rate was rapid (usually 110-130 bpm) and I frequently had feelings in my heart that left my short of breath for a few minutes.  My heart rate slowed down to normal (usually 70-85 bpm) and I very seldom have these episodes anymore.  I feel much better overall and I do not have that feeling of ""impending doom"".  Also my blood pressure is good and I do not have to take an extra medication for this problem. The only noticeable side effect for me is the drop in blood pressure, which for me has been beneficial. I have been told this medication can make you somewhat sleepy or lethargic, but I have not experienced this. I take Atenolol once a day in the morning and that's all the treatment that I need to keep the mitral valve in my heart function correctly.",high
inderal,9,"inderal severe performance anxiety - Miracle drug for anyone who's deathly afraid of giving speeches or oral presentations. Eliminates the whole butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, racing heart, sweaty palms and allows you to focus on what your doing and do it properly rather than worry about how nervous you are. None. The doc first suggested that I take paxil every day for 3 wks before a speech and then get off it. I had to push her to prescribe me Inderal instead because I had researched all the drugs extensively and new what I was looking for. Never rely entirely on the judgement of doctors, always verify their advice and do your own research.  It can save you time, money and alot of side effects.  

I take 3 small tablets and hour before a major speech or presentation (about once a year).  I am thinking about using it for situational anxiety as another user suggested, I had never thought about it as I try to stay as far from drugs as possible and I only use them in extreme situations, but I have missed many networking opportunities because of my anxiety and I think that this drug would have helped.  I have not experienced any side-effects.  I don't think the drug has significantly risky long-term effects.  I think the long-term negative effects of situational anxiety are far worse then the potential risks of inderal.",high
elidel,7,"elidel skin rash - Easy to use, no scent, absorbed quickly, rash cleared up None Contact dermatitis due to detergent allergy on hands.  Wouldn't go away with over the counter medications.  Used Elidel twice daily for approx one week.  Used gloves on hands at night to increase effectiveness of the product.  No side effects, no odor.  non greasy.  Cleared up the condition nicely.",high
retin-a-micro,3,"retin-a-micro acne - None that I had experienced. Redness the first week.  Then acne got worse. Decided to stop treatment after three months.  I was using it to get rid of small pimples on my forehead.  After using the product, I noticed I was getting bigger, and bigger pimples. So I stopped.",Low
clobex,10,"clobex hand dermatitis - This is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  My outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to 9 at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. With a shot of cortizone every couple of years, Clobex takes care of the rest.  When I do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if I treat them right away, I only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. I should mention that I need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks. Nothing bad. Put a very small amount on my hands, smooth over all of my fingers.  Use twice a day during an active outbreak.  Use a couple of times a week thereafter, as prevention.  I also use lots of moisturizer and wear gloves for cleaning tasks, etc.",high
fluvoxamine,5,"fluvoxamine anxiety/worry - None, especially surprising since the prescription name brand Luvox had been used previously, with great results.  The Luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry, while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing, and did not help with sleep. Some vague nausea, which was not a problem with the name brand drug. At the time of weaning my second child, I was apparently experiencing some hot flashes/night sweats and worry/ panic and tried fluvoxamine, the generic version of Luvox (which I had used previously by about four years).  I had successfully used Luvox and was able to discontinue it without any side effects or symptoms of worry returning.  This time only the generic was available to me so I tried it - thinking that it would be the same drug and provide similar results.  It did not.  I experienced nausea, and did not get any sleep benefits, although I felt that the Luvox had improved my sleep when taken at night; neither version of the drug caused any drowsiness.  I did not feel any improvement in symptoms with the generic version.  Perhaps my hormones needed to balance on their own, and were too intense for the fluvoxamine to modify.  I hope there will be something better available if menopause eventually causes a return of symptoms.  
Some generics are better than others, and individual reactions differ.  It is useful to have this rating information available to access online.",high
avita,8,"avita improvement of skin appearance, very very mild acn - Overall skin improvement: Skin feels softer, more radiant. Better complexion. Younger looking (my perception).

Skin turned slightly less oily. Number of blackheads reduced and became almost invisible. Very mild (non-lasting) skin irritation occassionally in combination with other cosmetics (cleanser). Very minor skin flakes occurred a few times (easily removed). Skin tone became slightly more pink (I actually see this as a positive thing). Nightly application of a dot of tretinoin cream all over my face (except for eyelids and lips) after cleansing.

At daytime skin was always protected with at least SPF 30.",high
synthroid,8,synthroid hypothyroidism - Synthyroid replaces thyroid hormones that provide energy and increase your metabolism. I had a small goiter that was diminished when I began taking the medicine. If I miss a few days I have very little energy and feel as if I'm carrying heavy suitcases around. My skin has white spots on it due to lack of pigment. I have read that Synthroid causes skin pigment loss and wrinkles. I f the dose is too high then i feel nervous and jittery. I take 100mcg every morning. It is suppose to be taken on an empty stomach but I simply take it before breakfast. My thyroid hormone levels have to be checked annually to make sure the dosage is effective.,high
suboxone,10,"suboxone opiate/heroin addiction - Was able to successfully, and completely, discontinue illicit use of heroin/opiates.  I did remain abstinent for a period of time w/o it, but no longer than 6-7 months.  Always at or before that point I would wind up relapsing again, with no good outcomes.  Have stayed opiate-free for 1 year, 9 months now, and continue suboxone treatment. Only negative(/side) effects noted are:
Don't take doses too close together - feel dehydrated, headaches, fatigued.
DO NOT neglect meeting w/prescribing physician for writing of next script. Ive had to miss 2+ appts before, and have gone b/t 1-6 days w/o medication.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST TO AVOID THAT. I initially started at 4mg (/half 8mg tablet) 1x in am.  Gradually rose to 1 8mg tablet 1x in am, and then 2 8mg tablets 1x in am.  I found that, as said above, if i took doses too close together (ex: Noon on Sunday, then 4am Monday), would feel odd, off, and very drained.  So now i take 1 8mg tab in am, and 1 8mg tab in pm.  Found to be very effective and feel very 'steady' and 'even' throughout the day, and night.  No issues with taking am/pm's too close together, or far apart.
Also go to group & individual counseling, and see psychotherapist (as well as intermittent AA/NA meetings) to stay active in Recovery and stay healthy and well, all around.  Also do the aforementioned to stay on top of depression and anxiety as well as reg life issues.",high
prilosec,10,prilosec acid reflux - disappearance of very severe symptoms of acid reflux and excessive stomach acid production which included ulceration on the esophagus and stomach lining. I am allergic to a great variety of prescription and over the counter drugs. When the patent for Prilosec expired my doctor prescribed Nexium which in a matter of  hours sent me to the emergency room with pancake size hives and disabling swelling of the joints. I went back to Prilosec (over the counter now) and  have been taking this medication faithfully for the past 17 or so years with no side effects or allergic reactions. 40 mg. once a day and more recently (for the past 5 or 6 years) 40 mg. every two days.,high

motrin,9,"motrin ankylosing spondalytis - Reduced intensity of morning stiffness, reduced length of morning stiffness, reduced pain, increase in range of movement some mild stomach discomfort particularly if taken without food or milk Depending on my arthritis pain, I would take 1 x 600mg Ibuprofen two to three times per day. During flare-ups, it was necessary to ""hit the pain hard"" and take 600 mg four times per day and on the very rare occasion 5 times per day (this has not been necessary for over 10 yrs.)",high
pristiq,10,"pristiq depression - No side effects, other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects, but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly. I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet. I would take one pill before bed time each day. I have noticed as with other anti-depressants I would have to take them at bed-time or they would keep me awake. I didn't notice any problems with prestiq when taken in the morning.",high
seasonique,4,"seasonique preventing pregnancy - preventing pregnancy This pill was great b/c i didn't have any periods and also prevented pregnancy, but that doesn't help you don't have ANY sex drive.

oracea,4,"oracea rosacea - Did not notice much difference in decrease of rosacea bumps or redness but the bumps seemed to increase briefly after I got off the Oracea. For approximately one week after discontinuing use. I used in conjunction with topical Finacea, which I applied twice a day, also prescribed for rosacea. None noticed though per the treatment details (see below) it was often difficult to take based on your eating schedule. Take one pill a day. Must take one hour befor eating or two hours after with plenty of water. Also need to avoid sunlight while on this product though that is a good recommendation for skincare regardless of medication.",Low

Depression The dermatologist tried several other options before going to Roaccutane. I tried using antibiotics, Retin A (which, knowing better now, I didn't use quite correctly), and Diferin gel. In the end, Roaccutane was the only thing that really mad a difference. I do, however, notice that my skin does look older than that of my peers. I don't know whether it is as a result of the Roaccutane, or whether it's just genetic.",high
doxycycline,8,"doxycycline acne - My acne did heal. I took it consistently for about 2 months and my acne healed up and my skin looked really good after a long time, but when I forgot to refill it, I started breaking out again. So after taking it again for a couple of weeks my skin started to clear up. I have not taken Doxycline for a few months now and my skin is doing good, besides the occasional break out. The side affects were almost unbearable but I was determined to get clear skin so went through with it. There are many rules to taking it, such as on an empty stomach, no lying down after taking it, 2 hours before or after antacids, iron or vitamins/minerals. You must take it on an empty stomach so the it absorbs more efficiently and works effectively, But it is painful. I would feel extremely nauseous with a really bad stomach ache. Sometimes when I was in the sun my skin was more sensitive. I had really bad almost like nodular acne . I visited with my dermatologist who gave me the option of taking Accutane or Doxycycline and i decided to to go with Doxycycline since Accutane had a considerable amount of side affects.",high

I was first told to take the pill, and then use the cream in 3 days if the pill did not work to reduce the yeast infection.  I took the pill for 3 days alone, without the cream, and saw no improvement.  I took the pill plus the cream for 4 more days, and it slowly started to clear up.  I was told that one pill, taken once, and not repeatedly each day, should have cleared it up.",Low

I use to feel like I could crawl out of my skin two weeks before my period after starting zoloft I notice a considerable difference.I also felt anxious and restless which has subsided with the use of the zoloft. I did not seem to be subjected to any side effect. I was concerned about weight gain, fatigue and uncontrolled hunger but I did not have any of these side effects. First you must be diagnosed with either anxiety or mild to moderate depression. You begin at a lower does to see how you manage with that then eventually if need be your perscriber can increase the dose. Their is no special time of the day to take it and you do not have to eat with it. The most important thing is it does not alter how you feel through out the day you do not get a sensation of being high or druged. There is no lasting effect, if you stop the drug it is out of your system the next day.",high

I had to go to an eye doctor & get eye drops.  My dermatologist started me back on the doxycycline & said I had to take it ""forever"". If if take the 100 mg, I get an upset stomach, so I called the doctor & asked him to replace the medication with two 50mg tablets each day, which I've been taking for a week & it works much better.

seroquel,7,"seroquel bipolar mania - I am using this on an as needed basis. I only take it a couple times a month, which is why 50mg still works for me.  I may have to go to 100mg though. If I have been up for 20-25 hours straight and if I am still ""bouncing off the walls"" (manic), then this is great stuff to have.
For as needed manic episodes and severe insomnia--this is great stuff. Biggest problem is the LONG half-half.  After sleeping for over 10 hours, I spend the next 6 hours after I wake up foggy-headed and VERY lethargic. After this I usually feel good again.

zomig,10,"zomig migraine - I would sell my soul to the devil to obtain this miracle pill.  In a little as 30 minutes the intense pain and nausea are gone after one zomig.  I have had migraines since in my early teens where I was unable to function for as long as 48 hrs.  I have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  Zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that I had missed.  I had a young family when I discovered Zomig and it was like a miracle was handed to me. Thankfully there are none.  I am able to function completely both at home and work.  There are 2 ways I take the drug.  If I feel the headache start and I am at work I take a pill and usually I get relief within 15 minutes.  The only drawback is that I may have to take another pill within 12 hours. On the other hand if I am able to take the pill and lay down for 20 minutes then usually I can get up and resume all of my activities.  This is truly my wonder drug that has allowed me to fully participate in life.  I do not know where I would be without it. None",high

As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd, a not quite 'here' feeling I don't think I have any side effects as such but I usually feel a little odd and very tired after a migraine but not sure if that is the after effects of the migraine or a side effect of taking Imigran. Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea. My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on, if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one, I tend to do this if the attack is servere, I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works.

He rarely skipped classes. This was not at all true when he was in high school (prior to starting the medication.) None. He was initially started on Concerta but he felt that the effects ""kicked in"" as he was leaving school and was having trouble sleeping (even though it was more than 12 hours later.)

zocor,9,"zocor high cholesterol - On Zocor my total cholesterol was lowered below 200 and my LDL was lowered below 100. I currently take Zocor 40mg and could probably reduce the amount I take to 20mg if I would dedicate myself to a serious diet and exercise program. I am a nurse and work nights so this is difficult. Zocor has kept my cholesterol down and reduced my risk for cardiovascular problems. I have had no side effects. I started out on Zocor 20mg and with diet and exercise was able to keep my cholesterol levels low. However, I started working as a night shift nurse and not eating as well and had to increase my dose to 40mg. This dose has kept my cholesterol levels under control even with lack of regular exercise and not the best diet.",high
zyban,10,"zyban smoking cessation - The treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness', lack of focus, fatigue and irrational mood swings that I had experienced on every other non-Zyban supported attempt to quit smoking. The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken. At 150mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. In contrast, at 300mg/d - which I could handle for only a short period - I felt ""shaky"" with restless legs and some insomnia. These problems went away when I reverted to 150mg/d. I feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose, and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. Perhaps Zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations. I began taking 150mg/d two weeks/ 14 days before my actual quit date. On the quit date, I also started a series of yoga classes and regular physical activity through the first few months of smoking cessation. I decided to continue taking Zyban beyond the recommended period to a full 3 months at 1 dose daily. In my experience, I would recommend a lower daily dosage of 150mg/d for a longer extended period of time given my success in using Zyban in this manner.",high
lamictal,8,"lamictal bipolar - I was hospitalized in January for suicidal thoughts/attempts. At the time, I had been diagnosed with clinical depression and prescriped antidepressants only. They would induce mania and I was totally out of control, so much so that I pretty much lost all of my friends and went through a divorce. At the hospital, I was diagnosed as bipolar and since taking Lamotrogine with Effexor, I've had no thoughts of suicide or cutting, which I used to do often. Some dizziness and vertigo.

neurontin,2,"neurontin chronic pelvic pain - Essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits. The main side effects were fatigue and dizziness, which became worse with increasing dose. This medication was intended to reduce patient use of narcotics by providing adjunctive treatment of chronic pelvic pain, as indicated by several studies. I have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. Most patients experience no benefit, or if there is any benefit, it occurs at small doses. Titrating the dose up seems to worsen side effects without providing any added benefit. In addition, it is a costly drug.",Low
synthroid,10,"synthroid underactive thyroid - The treatment benefits were to counteract underactive thyroid conditions. Specifically, it kept my metabolism from being too slow, which meant that it diminished face swelling, kept my skin and hair from becoming dry, and from me feeling unusually cold and tired. I did not experience any side effects from this medication. I am taking .125 of Synthroid once a day, every day. I take it in the morning, before I eat any food.",high
zyban,8,"zyban smoking cessation - assisted with stopping smoking vivid dreams, dry mouth 2 tablets each day - for 2 weeks continue smoking and then stop after 2 weeks. I don't know how this works but I really did not like smoking when taking this. The treatment still requires a fairly high degree of willpower to manage the cravings. I keep a checklist of things to do - brush my teeth, drink water, go for a walk. I have now been smoke free for 6 months and at times it's still hard - I do still get cravings but they don't last very long and I can control them. Another good tip I got was to put some butts in a jar with some water. A quick sniff of this and the thought of smoking goes away.",high

I've experienced no side effects, although there was some mild headache during the first day of use- this could have been due to other reasons. Moved to a new area with a lot of trees / greenry and experiecing temporary allergies while there. got prescribed flonase with dosage described above, and felt much better.",high
flexeril,9,"flexeril inflamed neck muscles - This muscle relaxer allowed me to sleep at night and wake up without a stiff neck. I was not in pain any longer at night. It made me groggy in the morning. After a few days this side effect seemed to go away. I had tweaked my neck muscles and was in a lot of pain. This helped me relax so the inflamed muscles could heal. To my surprise, it actually worked. I would definitely use it again.",high
zoloft,7,zoloft depression - I immediately felt my mood swings and irritability disappear and I became a nicer person again overnight. My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day. The main effects have been the chronic fatigue. Although I sleep fantastically each night I wake exhausted and spend the rest of the day feeling like I have a hang over. I have no energy all day and find that I don't want to do anything all day although I do wonder whether that is through no energy or motivation! Feeling so fatigued also makes you so low and depressed so thats no help in the long run.Also my libido completely disappeared especially in the early days although it is not fantastic now. Although this has been by far the best treatment drug I have tried in terms of treating my depression and mood swings and irritability at the moment I have chosen to withdraw from the drug due to the chronic fatigue which was bringing me down and beginning to make me low in another way. I have been told by the professionals that I have a chemical inbalance and that I have to take the anti-depressants like a diabetic has to take their insulin but for the moment I have chosen to have a moment drug free to find out what sort of person I am! I suspect I will last only a few weeks. Of of all the drugs I have tried this has been by far been the most successful for me in treating the symptoms.,high

provigil,8,"provigil daytime drowsiness - Good cognitive enhancer.  I like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  I don't like to feel like I need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition, I hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows Provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.

spironolactone,6,"spironolactone hormonal acne - decrease in acne, and less oil in skin and hair slight lack of energy, decreased sex drive, irregular menstrual cycle, - I experienced four periods in a span of a month and a half - slight dehydration, and more severe mood swings than usual I took 25mg twice daily for three months. It was definitely effective in treating my acne, although I still received breakouts - just not NEAR as many. It didn't take very long to kick in, but by the middle of the second month I started to notice my lack of sexual desire. Did that disappointment me? Yes. During the last month and a half I was having issues with my menstrual cycle. I had four periods during that time. My usual cycle is typically somewhere between 35 and 45 days. So this worried me a little. By the end of the third month I was experiencing mood swings. Caused by my irregular menstrual cycle? Possibly. I don't know for sure. I would wake up mad, have a wonderful day, and then come home and cry myself to sleep. And why would I be so upset? No freaking clue, but I do know that it was entirely exhausting. If it weren't for such side effects, I would have rated this drug higher because it did exactly what I wanted and cleared my skin up.",high
wellbutrin-sr,10,"wellbutrin-sr depression - The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect. Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together. I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants, but it is usually the other one (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me.",high
polymyxin-b,10,"polymyxin-b conjunctivitis - It relieved symptoms of conjuctivitis including iching, dryness, soreness, buildup of mucus and sensitivity to light.

metrogel,7,"metrogel rosecea on the face - The treatment benefits were that the skin on my face eventually returned to almost normal.  No more white scaly skin cells, no more red patches and lumps, which i think was inflammation, no more slight soreness, whilst using the cream. None I applied the gel to my face-underneath the eyes and on both sides of my nose twice a day for two months initially. There was a great improvement though it didn�t get rid of the condition completely.  I found the sun agravated the condition and the rednes and scaly skin would return and then I would use the cream for about a month until the rosacea disappeared.",high
benicar-hct,9,"benicar-hct high blood pressue --  diuretic - My blood pressure levels were controlled quite well.  However,  they spike from time to time,  not dropping until I take another dose. There were no side effects that I am aware of. The medication was prescribed to control symptoms of high blood pressure and water
retention that I was experiencing.

prozac,10,"prozac depression - In general, I have enjoyed daily happy moods and more energy. I am able to focus on tasks better and can accomplish more each day. Mood swings, irritability, and temper outbursts are rare. I have gone from below-average to above-average coping skills. Feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts no longer occur. Increased thirst and decreased libido. Before Prozac, for many years I was unable to experience sustained happiness or control my mood. I was irritable at least 10 days each month, had uncontrollable racing thoughts, experienced frequent temper outbursts, felt hopeless and worthless, did not view life as worthwhile, thought about suicide often and made several attempts. There was no joy in my life and I suffered from delibitating migraine headaches 5 or 6 times per year. When I went to the doctor, I was unable to stop thinking about suicide. My doctor put me on Prozac, 20 mg each a.m. and I improved dramatically in a few weeks. After 6 months, I felt like I was slipping back a little, so the doctor increased my dose to 40 mg each morning. As long as I take the Prozac, I am happy and stable and have maybe one migraine a year. About once a year I try to reduce the Prozac to 20 mg, but within 1 week symptoms begin to recur so I resume 40 mg daily.",high
prednisone,3,"prednisone pneumonia with associated cough - The drug really did help the inflammation of the lungs and cut down on the cough. Stomach upset,hunger, which lead to overeating, severe acne breakout of the face. I had a pretty bad case of pneumonia, which had culminated in a horrible hacking and convulsive cough that I could not get to go away. I was given Ceftin (I believe, can't remember the dose).  I was also prescribed an inhaler and the prednisone. I had never taken a steroid of any kind before.  The first couple of days were okay, though I noticed I felt constantly hungry or my stomach hurt slightly, it was actually hard to tell which it was. So, I was eating a lot of crackers and thinks that I thought would help.  After the five days my skin began to break out all along the jaw line and forehead, which was not usually a problem for me. The breakout was so bad, I went to see a dermatologist who put me on a month of tetracycline, which cleared up the skin.  Overall, the prednisone made me feel lousy!  I hope I never ever need it for anything again.",Low

Also a reduction in bloating of the stomack and cramps. i was also able to eat a more varied diet without the awful symptoms of burning and indigestion which normally accompany the acid reflux. i have to say that i didn't really have any major side effects from this drug, ceratinly none that would out weigh the positives.i did experience constipation on a regular basis but i increased my fibre and fruit and vegatable intake to counteract this problem.i also did experience and increase in headaches, but they were very mild. Losec tablets contain a medicine called omeprazole.This belongs to a group of medicines called ""proton pump inhibitors"" They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces.

If I took it once a day at about 8 am I would feel hungry at about 5pm.  If I took it twice a day 8 am 10am I could make it to bedtime without being hungry. Side effects were random for me most of the times.  I would definitely NOT feel the energy that it was supposed to give me.  Sometimes when I would take it it would have the opposite affect on me and actually make me crash.  On some days it would make me feel foggy and other days I'd feel crisp and clear.  I also broke out with pimples on it.  You have to remind yourself to eat.  Some days I'd also have trouble falling a sleep. I would take 1 30mg pill in the morning at about 8am and then another 30mg pill at about 10am (sometimes trouble falling asleep if taken later).  I have done that for 2 months.

Diminished acne resulted within the first month and more significantly for the following months. After 1 year, patient reduced to taking pill once per day. Side effects were mild, but a similar derivative had significant side effects so this patient recommends trying another sulfur-based drug if this once poses problems. Side effects with trimethoprim included very mild sun sensitivity-simply use a sunscreen; occasional yeast infections once or twice per year; upset stomach if taken without food.

accolate,1,"accolate capsuar contracture of breast implant - The benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem I was experiencing.  At the time when I was experiencing complications from the implants, I truly believed that my Doctor did not prescribed the drug in time.  The literature I read on this drug claims that it is more likely to work if used early in the treatment of Capsular Contracture. I tolerated the medication very well.  I didn't experience any illness or side effects from Accolate.  I felt a strong mental negativity towards the drug when it was prescribed based on the literature I read and my Doctor's statement about being treated early.  I think I tried the treatment knowing in my mind that it was not going to work. I was required to take Accolate for three months to promote softening of my Breast Implants. The 20mg tablets were to be taken twice daily along with continued daily massage of my breasts.  My Doctor said that the treatment had more chances of being effective if used early in detecting the Capsular Contracture (My treatment was started 5 months after the breast implant surgery).

Tetracycline was heavy on the stomach and if you ask me added to yellowing of my teeth but that is a subjective view. Mostly it caused stomach gas and disturbance. I had constant vaginal yeast infections because (I believe) of the imbalance of good bacteria. The treatment was, at that time, one of the treatments for acne. Being a systemic treatment, it did decrease the acne lesions but only on continued use. As soon as it was discontinued, the acne returned as usual. It was to use 2x per day indefinitely and so was not the best idea but at the time did prevent the gross acne lesions that would have occured without.",high

Initially, but eventually disappearing side effects: drowsiness, severe nausea, inability to achieve orgasm, trembling, lack of affect.

I noticed that when I was 45 the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  My gastroenterologist prescribed Nexium, which I took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. Then the other symptoms above emerged. When I started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and I rarely ever have stomach problems now. None at all that I am aware of. Prior to taking the oral treatment I used the cream, to avoid the digestive tract altogether.  This was fine for about a year, but then the symptoms reappeared.  My physician felt that something was interfering with the absorption of the hormones and so prescribed the oral pill and the symptoms have nearly disappeared and I have had no associated stomach problems.   I am convinced that much of my stomach problems throughout my life were associated with a hormonal imbalance, but cannot prove this.  I do know that this is the best my stomach has ever been in my entire life, for whatever reason.",high

Quite effective in curing acne, but takes months and situation gets worse in the first week to month. Tazorac can peel the skin severely when used together with other medication.  Still moderate peel when applied once every night. I'm an Asian female in my 30s and have been having moderate acne problem for over 20 years.  Amoung over-the-counter medication, only benzal peroxide works for me, but I still have break-outs from time to time.

dapsone,8,"dapsone dermatitis herpetiformis - Dapsone treated the intensly itchy skin condition quickly and efficiently.  A gluten free diet alone did not relieve this condition. The side effects after one year have been a slight decrease in red blood count.  There has also been an onset of shakyness which I believe has been a side effect. 2-100mg tablets are taken at bedtime.  The dosage is self medicating, which means that if the condition is under control I can lower the doseage to see if the contrlo can be maintained at a lower dose.  So far, after one year, I have been unable to do so.",high

renova,10,"renova aging skin, few break-outs, hyperpigmentation - My skin is clear and people have complimented me on the appearance of my complexion.  My rosacea is under control, my hyperpigmentation is fading No side effects except that I notice my skin is a bit tighter/drier, but this could be because it's winter  and I need a much better day/night  moisturizer. I alternate glycolic acid 20% cream, tretinoin .05% cream, or Noritate cream under day or night moisturizer (ie a different treatment applied morning and night; the next day starts with treatment not used previously)",high

wellbutrin,8,"wellbutrin depression - The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a ""zombie"" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants. At first I had crazy dreams, whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks, then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight, which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either, so that was positive. I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg, the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug, but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience, although I was glad to not need it anymore.",high

After my doctor prescribed Lunesta, it was the first time in a very long time, that I was able to sleep from the time I laid my head on the pillow until my alarm sounded in the morning. I had no side effects from using Lunesta.  I felt refreshed in the morning without that groggy feeling or ""hang over"" like feeling.

I have not had a reoccurance of breast cancer while on the drug, though unsure we can attribute that with the drug treatment itself.  Perhaps there are other positive health-related items coming into play, such as exerciase and eating habits.  Not aware of any side effects or adverse reactions.  Drug is very expensive, however. As mentioned above, I have not had any side effects from Aromasin other than hot flashes and night sweats.  These may be due to menopause rather than the treatment itself. The hot flashes have been relatively mild and can be controlled, for the most part, by limiting or removing all alcoholic beverages. After breast cancer treatment of chemo. and radiation I was put on Tamoxifen for several years, about 5 years.

Flexeril took care of most of the pain and much of the swelling. I felt much less alert -- not tired or sleepy, exactly, but sort of like inebriated, but without the buzz.

methadone,6,"methadone opiod addiction - It worked but then I became addicted to methadone so basically it just traded one addiction for another. I don't take as many Methedone a day as I did pain pills because Methadone is long lasting so I guess it did help me. At first I got painful headaches but that subsided after continued use. I do still have horrible constipation and  I have sexual dsyfuntion. I began recieving Methadone when I was 21 years old. I started seeing a pschiatrist because I needed help for pain pill addiction. I began getting prescriptions for hydrocodone when I was 19. I have an abnormality in my lower back which causes me severe pain. I began taking more than I was supposed to for the pain and was taking anywhere from 20 to 30 pain pills a day. So I knew I needed help. That's when my doctor gave me Methadone. He gave me 60mg a day but I usually only took 40mg depending on what I needed. Over the years I have weaned myself down to 20mg a day and everyone even my doctor says to me that I should be able to come off of these pills easily but no one understands the physical and psychological symptoms I go through. It's so hard to just stop taking them when I have became so depended on them in my daily life. I have four kids and with out them I feel like a different person and it takes everything in me to get out of bed and take care of my kids. Is it in my head? I don't know but either way, in a lot of ways it helped me but in a lot of ways it ruined my life. I don't want to be addicted to a pill for the rest of my life. Now my doctor has stopped giving them to me because he feels that I can come off them easily at such a low dose but what does he know he does not understand what it feels like. I am at such a downfall in my life, I have to buy them now just to feel normal every day. I feel like if these doctors give them to me then they should help me with the withdrawals ao I can get off them. I still need help after all these yesrs.

neurontin,6,"neurontin low back pain, radiating to left leg - To tell the truth, I did not benefit very much from this medication, even though I was taking maximum doses, the pain remained almost the same with or without medication. Maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment, unfortunately not in my case. I did not experience many side effects, even though I was taking many pain medications at a time, I could say very little drowsiness, but compared with other people taking the same medication, I would say I tolerated quite well the medication. My medical condition was the result of a disc herniation at L5-S1 level, with no compression of the nerve root, besides use of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and Neurontin, I had little response. I underwent also Phisiotherapy, Ultrasonograpy and other therapy. I have to say that finally I decided to receive alternative therapy (Accupunture) and started practising Qi Gong and that in a few weeks I abandoned all medication and the pain began to ameliorate to a total recovery.

lamotrigine,9,"lamotrigine bipolar disorder - I began taking this medication during a very unstable period in my life and when I had been rapid cycling and experiencing mixed states, and over a 2 yr period it greatly helped increase my self-worth and overall stability. It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it. I feel like I am not overly leveled out and blah like I felt with Depakote, more like I avoid the worst and can be in control. After 2 years and stopping for several months then starting again, I developed a rash which my psych guessed was the lamictal, although i don't understand why it started suddenly after so long!

As long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective. When I fell behind on the regular application of the ointment, the dermatitis would flare up within 2-3 days.  Unfortunately, the ointment fails to ""cure"" the problem and only treats the symptoms. The application is very simple.  Just apply the ointment to the affected area(bottoms of my feet) twice a day.  The Dr. recommended I exfoliate the area regularly to remove any build-up of skin.  Following that recommendation I would use a pumice stone 4-5 times a week prior to applying the treatment.",high
paxil,4,"paxil panic attack and anxiety - The Paxil relieved my anxiety and mild panic attacks at first. After time my doctor needed to increase the dose to get the same effect. The side affects were that I needed an abnormal amount of sleep.  The higher the dose the more time I slept.  Also my blood pressure went up and I gained a lot of wieght. I started with half a 10mg pill a day. It was the increased to a full 10mg a day.  I then went to a 10mg and a half pill a day. Then went to 20mg a day.
I then went off Paxil entirely. My blood pressure went down and I lost a good anount of wieght but not all that I had gained. I did have some very high axiety at first but then it subsided.",Low
retin-a,8,"retin-a acne - Regular use of Retin A cleared my acne dramatically. Initially, I experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. This lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. Within about six weeks, I would guess my skin was 75% clearer. Over the past twelve years, I have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse. Redness and mild to moderate irritation initially. Photosensitivity (use a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen). Seasonal changes can increase dryness. Cleanse face with a mild soap each night. While skin is still wet, apply Retin A (pea sized amount will cover entire face). Allow to air dry completely. Wash off in AM, pat dry, and apply moisturizer/sunscreen.",high
nexium,10,"nexium acid reflux - Total recouperation from a long battle with acid reflux and stomach pains. Absolutely none.  This medication is so much better than taking antacid tablets day after day and meal after meal. Following my initial dose of the medication it would take several hours for my symptoms to subside. They did subside in the first days but would return after about 8 hours or so.  After about a week of daily dosing my acid reflux did not return regularly and my stomach pains subsided as well.  By the end of week 2 I was symptom free. After I stopped my course of treatment many weeks went by with no return of symptoms. Since then, I have had one flare up.  I restarted my course of treatment with the same results and now have been close to a year symptom free.  I am very, very happy with Nexium.",high

May have contributed to my insomnia. Before I started taking Effexor I had tried Lexapro and Cymbalta with unsatisfactory results.  Having weaned off those, it was hard just to get out of bed - I was missing work and couldn't hold it together at all.  Within a couple of days of taking this I started to feel better.  It's been the best so far at managing my depression but I still needed other drugs to help with mood swings and anxiety.  Overall a good payoff, just wish it was generic!",high

I already suffer from constipation, but I took one of these tablets, as prescribed, for two consecutive days.  After two days I knew they were a no-no for me.  My innards came to a complete STOP. I shall throw the remainder of the tablets away.  Four days on my innards are still at a standstill. Take one per day.

I have stopped taking them.  Don't forget I already take Dulcolax for my constipation, had I known these recommended tablets had a side effect of constipation I would have refused them.

retin-a,8,"retin-a adult acne - After weeks of use, I did see a considerable decrease in pimples on my face.  Being in my 40's, I saw a benefit in my skin tone also. The cream is very drying, despite putting a moisturizer on after it.  In the winter, I sometimes cannot use it on a daily basis since my skin will peel.  In addition, I have to make sure the cream goes no where near my eye area, since my eyes will tear the next day if the cream gets within 1 inch from my eye.  The cream makes a person more sun sensitive also; however, I always wear a 45 sunscreen.  I cannot use on my neck since I got a rash every time I tried.  The side effects are far less than any of the oral medications my dermatologist tried with me. After washing my face and allowing it to dry, I apply the Retin-A in small amounts over my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead.  I use it every night, except when my skin is peeling too much from use.  Then I either switch to every other night, or put a moisturizer on first (incidentally, my dermatologist said the Retin-A should be put on first, under the moisturizer).  I rarely ever get pimples in the areas I use the product.  Even though there are some side effects, the benefits outweigh that.",high

diclofenac,6,"diclofenac pinched nerve from bulging disc & disseminated pai - The pain was greatly diminished and I was able to live my life in relative comfort. It caused my liver function tests to become elevated.  This was discovered by accident on a routine physical. I was taken off the diclofenac to see if that was the cause of the elevated liver enzymes; the tests were repeated about 6 weeks later.  They came back normal once the drug was out of my system.  I went back to suffering a great deal of pain and was sent to physical therapy, which didn't help.  I ended up having a nerve block done for the spinal problem, which has fixed the pain.  The other disseminated pain I have, was later treated very successfully with tramadol, 100 mg., two 3X daily, plus gabapentin, 600 mg, one 3X daily.",high
seroquel,8,"seroquel bipolar/raciness/insomnia - better sleep, less raciness tired during the day.  wetting my pants at night.  weakness during day started at around 300mg and went up to 900mg but that was too much.  Then moved to 600mg and doing fine..  I think a person needs to find the minum dose that works to avoid side effects.  I am told that many people need high doses in the 600 to 800mg range to get results..",high
levoxyl,8,"levoxyl hypothyroidism - Started taking this drug in 2002 due to a high TSh reading, asymptomatic. Took it for 8 years raising my dose after about 5years from 50 mcg to75 mcg. Six months ago I developed panic attacks,speediness,anxiety,gastric issues,dizziness very suddenly with a sudden drop in my TSH from a steady 1.8-2.0 to as low as .20.  Continued to take the Levoxyl but dropped dosage back to 50mcg and hope to become asymtomatic shortly. Take Xanax for the panic attacks as needed. Am hoping to perhaps supplement the T4 with T3 Cytomel or something for the depression. See above Above",high
valtrex,10,"valtrex herpes - I used to have at least 3 herpes outbreaks in the course of a year. These would interfere with personal time with my spouse, backpacking trips, day to day comfort.  In the time I have taken Valtrex I have not had one outbreak, and don't have to think about it any longer. In the first weeks 2-3 I would have frequent low grade headaches, and a generally tired feeling.  But after I got used to the medication I didn't have any side effects. Took one 500mg pill every morning.  That's it.",high
klonopin,7,"klonopin anxiety - I felt relaxed, could sleep, good drug to be lazy on. If I felt panicky and wanted to relax I could. I don't have alot of benefits to say because I think the grouchiness outweighs the good side effects to me! Very grouchy! To the point I wanted to argue with people. Just felt on edge, relaxed if I laid around but get up and do something just mean and grouchy! I seem to want to eat more too when I first started it. Not when taken but craved sweets. 1/2 a pill twice daily for 20 days and 1/2 a pill when anxious. This treatment was to make sure I didn't get panicky and could relax. I did feel relaxed but grouchy!",high

estratest,10,"estratest menopausal symptoms - Completely stopped hot flashes and night sweats. (I think there was also some mild improvement in skin thickness as well but it certainly did not end cellulite!) Initially took full strenth tabs and I did experience some menstrual bleeding as a result. This did not happen with the hs tabs.

On the other hand, thanks to the increased amount of tetosterone in the full strenght tabs, my interest in sex improved on these. Not so much with the half strength tabs. I had a salivary estrogen level test done while I was on this medication. Although it completely stopped menopausal symptoms my estrogen levels were still very low. So I'm not particularly concerned about adverse effects of estrogen treatment on these...",high
vicodin,7,"vicodin pain from broken arm - It took the ""edge"" off the pain, for sure.  Without the medication I don't know how I could have put up with it. I was so out of it from the one pill, mouth hanging open, drooling, to take I had to cut it in half.  I also experienced digestive distress, and overall yucky feeling, not some blissfully pain free state. My arm was shattered..the bone was separated about 1/2 an inch at the upper arm, and a crack ran down a few inches to another break.  It was excruciating, but the 1/2 pill was enough to dull the pain to the point where I could sleep, and make it up to go to the restroom. The Vicodin was for the pain of the broken arm.  The arm was in a plastic type of cast and sling.  After 8 weeks I was able to remove the sling but the shoulder had ""frozen"" by then so the physio required was just as painful!",high
mobic,9,"mobic arthritis - Less pain in joints and back. Was able to do activities with my daughter  again. I stopped taking it for about 6 weeks and noticed a significant increase in pain. When I resumed taking it and symptoms faded. I had no noticable side effects. I was warned that there could be possible stomach upset, and if this were to occur then I should take with food. Three tablets daily.",high
keppra,10,keppra simple partial seizure - The benefits of taking all these asthma medications is that I have been pretty much symptom free.  The Flovent has been particularly helpful in preventing flareups of my symptoms which has greatly reduced the need for my Albuterol.  The benefits of taking the Keppra is that I have only had one seizure episode since I began treatment in 2006.  The episode lasted only seconds. I have no side effects from taking my asthma medications.  I experienced a lack of enery or just feeling tired when I first started taking the Keppra in the morning.  I do not have that system any longer. I take my asthma medications daily and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.  The same is true for my seizure medication.,high
lipitor,7,"lipitor high blood pressure - Noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  If the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  When the Lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within 1/2 an hour.  The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  Therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life. Erectile function seemed to be mildly affected by this drug.  Sexual performance became slightly more challenging once the patient began taking this medication and was noticeably improved when the patient missed a dose. Lipitor was administered in pill form.  The patient received the prescription from a sliding scale clinic.  The patient also received a cardiogram, which revealed a 30% blockage.  Alcohol consumption, diet, and exercise are the primary barriers to this patient's health improvement.  He consumes an average of ~6 alcoholic beverages per day.  His diet includes many whole grains and vegetables, but also a large amount of fat and cholesterol.  The patient exercises sparatically and becomes fatigued quickly during physical activity.  Patient smoked for several years, but quit approximately 2 years ago.",high

During first week of treatment I experienced a minor headache after application. Was prescribed this drug in a 5% solution by my dermatologist when suffering from Alopecia Androgenetica. He advised to apply a 1 ml dose twice daily.,high
lamotrigine,7,"lamotrigine major depression - It started working immediately which was wonderful.  My energy level increased, I was more interested in going out rather than hiding in my house.  I've increased to 100mg 2x's a day.  I've lost approximately 25 pounds but I think that's because of an interaction from the Concerta & Lamotrigine. Within 2 months I noticed my eyes felt strained all the time so I continually have to refocus.  I get tremors in my hands every couple days and can't stop them from shaking.  The worst - and the reason I'm choosing to change medications is the excessive sweating.  I use clinical strength deodorant 3x's per day but I can't go through the summer being self conscious of how I smell.  I constantly check my arm pits for sweat marks. I started out with 25mg and moved quickly up to 200mg per day.  I increased to 250mg but found no benefit so I dropped back down 200mg.  If I didn't have the sweating side effect I would DEFINITELY continue to take this drug.",high

biaxin,10,biaxin sinus infection with smelly nasal discharge - It effectively treated my maxillary sinus infection.  No more smelly nasal discharge and I could see the result within the first day of taking this drug. No major side effects I could tell except a constant mild headache that did not really bother much. I have had a maxillary sinus infection after a flu for 3 weeks and it would not go away.  The nasal discharge had a very unpleasant smell and taste.  My doctor first prescribed Cefuroxime 250mg and I took that for 10 days with no results.  I then went to my dentist to have my teeth checked to see if they might have been the cause.  The dentist found nothing but prescribed Biaxin 500mg for me to take for the infection.  The smelly nasal discharge decreased substantially after the first day of taking this antibiotic!

I have a job where I have to be 100% focused all day, and it's difficult getting out of the morning fog sometimes. I know there are issues with weight gain.  Because of the sedative effects, this makes natural sense.  I would advise people to try to incorporate as much exercise in their daily lives as possible to combat the weight gain.  Also, if you typically take the drug at night, as I do, try not to eat at least 3 hours before bedtime.  This is hard, but I have learned it is a small sacrifice so I feel more mentally stable.",high

I have never seen such a bad diaper rash on either of my babies. I took her in on the 3rd day of treatment and had the medication changed and both of her rashes went away in two days. The rash on her body looked like round welts and they were very itchy. They spread very fast starting as a ring around her whole waist, around her chest and behind her ears. It was blistered.  It also looked like round mosquito bites the size of a dime on her arms and legs. They also lost their appetite. This was to treat an ear infection in both ears. The side effects from this medication were way worse than the ear infestion itself. It was extrememly scary to see how this medicine took hold of my 1 year old daughter's body. My son who is 2 was perscribed this medication on Friday due to a bronchial virus, he was also given a shot of antibiotics and given a cough suppressent. The augmenton did not give him the skin rash but he has a horrible diaper rash and it is extremely painful. He is not sleeping very well either and also has diarrhea. He was percribed the medicine on Friday and I didn't realize it was the same medication my daughter had two weeks ago. I will be calling my doctor this morning to explore other options of medication to get him better. This augmenton is bad for my babies. I hope it helps other people.

HOWEVER IN 2001 THE PROB CAME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE AND I NEEDED SURGERY AND WAS VERY ILL - IT WOULD HAVE HELPED IF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAD TAKEN SOME INTEREST IN ME AND HADN'T SIMPLY TOLD MW I WAS TRESSED AND TO GO AWAY. PRIVATE CONSULTATIONS FINALLY MEANT THAT I WAS REFERRED TO A CONSULTATN AND HAD THE SURGERY THE SURGERY MEANT I HAD NO MORE PAIN. AND IN FACT THE TABLETS ARE THE VERY OLD STYLE SULFASALZINE. THEY ARE NOT THE ENTERIC COATED ONES.I DO NOT NOTICE ANY SIDE EFFECTS APART FROM OCCASIONAL YELLOW STAINS. i AM CAREFUL NOT TO DRINK TOO MUCH AS THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM. ALSO IF MY LIVER HAS TO WORK HARD BECAUSE OF THE TABLETS, THEN THE LEAST I CAN DO IS NOT OVERSTRAIN IT. OTHERWISE THERE ARE NO SIDE EFFECTS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

yasmin,8,"yasmin birth control - easy prevention of pregnancy. Not many - some mild bloating about a week before period, some moodiness.  I don't think this prescription is the best for any type of PMS symptoms, but since I don't really suffer from this, it was not a problem for me. One pill taken at around the same time daily.  The packaging is easy to follow - it has different stickers so that you can start the pcak on any day, not just Sunday.  This pill is pretty expensive, around $$50 per month.  I think some of the generics are much cheaper.",high
hyoscyamine,9,"hyoscyamine irritable bowel syndrome - This medicine improved irritable bowel symptoms of cramping and constipation. No diarrhea was present before or during course of medicine. There were no side effects other than slight drowsiness with the first few doses.  After first few doses I didn't notice the drowsiness anymore. After suffering with worsening IBS symptoms of frequent bowel movements, cramping, and constipation for several years and trying dietary management of symptoms, the hyomax improved my symptoms to a manageable level with the first use.",high

This worked for several years. When spouse endured 3 years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to 40 mg taken as 2 20mg pills.",high
lexapro,6,"lexapro depression - The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases. On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal. The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.",high

imitrex,5,"imitrex migraine - Imitrex was the miracle drug for me at first. Suffered with migraines since the age of 7 and never got relief except through ER shot of stadol/phenergen starting at age 27. So when doc gave me imitrex shot the first time I thought I found my miracle. 
It does get rid of the pain completely. I have no complaint about that.
I used to only get migraines once or twice a month. A bit tired feeling...sort of lathargic or weak feeling.
Here is the bad for me. Since taking imitrex, the frequency of migraines have increased. I got rebound from this drug everytime I use it. It'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but I cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. I've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but I can no longer take it. Again about the rebound effect. Some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. I took nothing else...no OTC drugs or anything else for the headach. ONLY the imitrex. When I realized what was happening I stopped taking drug and just suffer through as I used to. That's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less.",high
botox,8,"botox wrinkles, furrows - The furrows (lines above my eyes) on forehead disappered. They started reappearng after about three months. I looked younger. I also didnt look look like i was frowning all of the time. The initital injection was very painful. I had a very bad headache for about two days after the treatment. Also after about a year of the treatments i started noticing lines on the sides of my forehead, which my doctor said was unrelated to the botox, but i know someone else who got them as well. The treatment consisted of injected 2 syringes, one on each side of the furrows lines on my forehead. The doctor said I could also have them injected on the sides of the eyes but i opted not to. Probably because of the pain.",high

vyvanse,10,"vyvanse adhd - Sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  Easy to take, just one pill a day! I had no side effects with this drug!  I loved it. Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD.  It is a time-released capsule.  It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills), and does not upset your stomach.  I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills! I was self-pay though, so I'm sure having insurance would be ideal! Although it is very expensive, it is well worth it.",high
flexeril,8,"flexeril migaine/tension headches - Well, I started on Flexeril about five days to a week ago. I felt a calm feeling and also it kind of helped my anxiety. It helped my headches a lot. I did have one side effects that was annoying: restless legs. It made me a little drowsy. I have been taking different narcotic painkillers for years, and I just reached a point that there were too many side effects so I decided to talk to my doctor. He took me off the painkillers and tried a few muscle relaxers such as: Robaxin and Norflex-they did not work at all. I started on Motrin 800 and Flexeril, Flexeril is helping me a lot and I would definately recommend it to others",high
anafranil,9,"anafranil ocd - decreased anxiety constipation and dry mouth I have been taking the medication for about 2 months and my anxiety from my obsessions has decreased significantly.

alprazolam,10,"alprazolam panic disorder - Control of Panic Attacks that interrupted daily activity. Treatment of sudden increased anxiety, tachycardia, shortness of breathe, due to stress, general anxiety disorder. None At the start of this disorder I thought I was having a heart attack, was in the Dr's office with an EKG racing at 115 beats fluctuating from 85, short of breath and nurse asking me if I am ok. I simply told her, this is why I am here, for absolutely no reason my body is doing this craziness.  Panic disorder or general anxiety probable cause stress. I did not feel stressed so this confused me further.

One 30 day prescription of 0.25mg pills can last anywhere from two months to six months. As needed works great for me as when I know my heart starts racing and the adrenaline starts pumping for no reason, half of 0.25mg pill will offset that attack. I am also a smoker so reduced 50% absorption, is enough to stop the panic. I do not take this medication daily and have not for over 10 years. I only use it when I can not control the imbalance, if I can not lower my heart rate with breathing etc., I will then take a half which brings it under control.

I believe in my case it is more of an imbalance or even a food allergy causing the disorder, I am glad to have the smallest dosage alleviate the symptoms when needed.",high
vivelle-dot,10,"vivelle-dot hormone replacement - I began using Vivelle patches shortly after my hysterectomy five and one-half years ago. I have more stability in my moods w/ better emotional control. I have fewer episodes of irritability and feel more calm and collected. I don't experience any of the physical symptoms of menopause like, hot flashes. I had absolutely no side effects from the HRT.  I feel wonderful.  I would like to use HRT forever. I apply a patch about every 4 days, even though my gynecologist recommended one every 3 because my prescription plan will only pay for one pack per month, which only contains 8 patches. Hello! That only covers 24 days. Do they not know that there are at least 30 days in a month?!  By the time the fourth day arrives, I find myself feeling more irritable.  My husband will even notice and say to me, ""Did you change your patch recently""? He even notices how much more 'even keeled' I am with it.I used the .1mg patch for 3 and a half years, then went to the .075mg patch for 1 and a half years, and have now been on the .05mg patch for 6 months.  The only reason I tapered it was because of the concerns listed in the research and upon advisement of my physician. I prefer the 1mg patch and would like to use it until I die!  I apply the patch just below my waistline on the left side of my hip area, then when I change it I place the new one in the same area on my right side. It's easy, simple and so-o-o-o- effective!",high
climara,10,"climara menopausal - Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch. The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal. After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.",high
botox,9,"botox facial lines - General anti aging effects on the face. Decrease in current facial lines and wrinkles and prevention of formation of new lines and wrinkles. Slight bruising,could affect facial expression if overused creating a ""frozen"" expressionless upper face. Subdermal injections to various areas of the face, crow's feet around eyes, horizontal lines between eyebrows and vertical lines on forehead.",high
neurontin,8,"neurontin depression - Neurontin coupled with a stimulant such as caffeine gave me a warm sense of well being and evenness.  However, the drug acted merely as a Novocaine to numb my depression and did nothing to help correct my brain chemistry.  That said, it was an effective enough band-aid that I suffered the sexual side effects in order to take it as prescribed. Sexual side effects included inability to achieve a full erection (when summoned) and inability to orgasm/ejaculate.

Softening of the stool- this problem lessened when I switched from tablets to capsules.

Memory problems and difficulty speaking. I was prescribed Neurontin for severe depression in 8/09.  As of 9/10, I am still taking it but considering ECT.",high
evista,9,"evista atypical breast biopsy - It is supposed to lower the risk of breast cancer.  There was another abnormal mammogram & biopsy two years after starting it, but the biopsy was less abnormal. So no cancer is a benefit. There was NO improvement in bone density.

chantix,8,"chantix smoking ceasation - initially made it easier physically to stop smoking however still craving but know that smoking will not give me the same feeling or be as enjoyable due to the blocking of the nicotine receptors being blocked by the drug, so have not smoked. Full dose made me extremely nasious so am only taking 1 mg at night.  Also, constipation. Take 1 tablet in AM and one tablet in PM with food and 8 oz of water",high
femhrt,5,"femhrt menopause - reduced hot flashes; reduced heart palpitations mood swings; not enough estrogen I started taking the drug 2 months ago to streamline a regime that consisted of taking estrodial and a progestrene cream.  So far, I feel it doesn't have enough estrogen to regulate mood swings and dryness of skin. I also have breast tenderness and continued heart palpitations. I think I prefer going back to activella along with the progestrone cream.",high
requip,8,"requip restless leg syndrome - I took this medication to treat restless leg syndrome and it was very effective. It made me drowsy at first, but once I took it for a few weeks, it just made my legs stay still so I could sleep.  I was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients, but at a much lower dose.  I did need to take a but more as time went on, but it was still effective.  Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it when I got pregnant, since it is a category c medication. I did need to take more as time went on, and I experienced augmentation of the restless leg syndrome.  The symtpoms would begin earlier in the evening and I would try to take the medication sooner, because if I did not take it before the symptoms set in, it was much less effective and would take longer to work.  That was really the only unfortunate effect of the medication. I took one milligram at night to treat the symtoms of restless leg syndrome.  I had a sleep study which showed that my legs about every two minutes while I was sleeping and that brought me out of a deep sleep.  My doctor put me on requip to keep my legs still so I could fall asleep and get better rest.  It worked well.  I had tried all sort of behavioral remedies to help with my legs and nothing had helped until this medication.  I slept better than I ever had since I could really relax instead of waiting for the nightly discomfort in my legs.",high
prozac,8,"prozac anxiety - helped my anxiety, and overall mood.  I feel like I am less anxious and more calm.  I feel that my moods are more even.  I don't know what the long term effects are of taking this medication, though, and worry that I may get a stomach ulcer since I take over the counter pain relievers. none really, but I have noticed an increase in tiredness I take one capsule in the morning, as prescribed by the doctor.",high
zoloft,5,"zoloft post partum anxiety/ depression - in a very short amount of time all of my anxiety was gone which was worth the side effects. my depression decreased as well. the most annoying were the night sweats other than that nothing really that i noticed. i was prescribed zoloft in the past and it worked well, so my doctor thought that we should try it again for my anxiety and depression.  it worked very well in a short amount of time.  it was worth the night sweats to have normal days.",high
ultram,10,ultram fibromyalgia - I've suffered with pain for 11 years now.  I was on Loritab for those 11 years.  I was getting 120 10mg filled every 15 days.  They would kind of knock the edge off my body pain but I had a constant headache.  My Dr. recently prescribed me Tramadol. Nervous the first day.  No side effects since then. I take 2 50mg tablets every 4-6 hours (no more than 8 a day).  It has worked wonders for me.  No more headaches and my body is only slightly sore now.  It has elevated my mood simply because it has reduced the pain.,high
xanax,10,"xanax anxiety - Would bring down anxiety levels from an incapcitating point to a managable level on most occasions. Sometimes it could literally make the difference between being able to leave the house or not. Provided tremendous relief from the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of anxiety.

Worked very well as a sleep aid. Seldom experienced middle of the night waking. Dosages beyond .5 mg. could sometimes cause drowsiness. Not a problem at night, but had to be careful taking medication when working or driving. Initially prescribed 1 mg. 3x a day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.

skelaxin,7,"skelaxin neck & arm muscle spasms - The Skelaxin aided in my recovery from cervical disc surgery.  It eased muscle spasms and tightness in my neck, chest and arm. The Skelaxin would (at times) make me sleepy.  And it would relax my stomach muscles, allowing stomach acid to creep up into my throat and cause a burning sensation. The AcipHex would keep the stomach acid under control. As a result of my cervical disc (5-7) surgery, my neck, chest, left shoulder/arm/hand and face have a tendency to become inflamed if I lift something heavy, I am tired or I over use my arm.  Therefore, I continue to take the medications to ease my pain and numbness.  Additionally, I use Motrin IB, 200-800mg, as necessary.",high

zoloft,9,"zoloft pmd - I was having difficulty controlling my temper, having loss of motivation, anxiety.  This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings. I didn't notice any side effects except that it seemed to mess with weight loss.  Going off the medication for the periods indicated by my dr seemed to help. I was advised to take the medication daily for the week leading to my period starting.  My dr said that through trial and error I would find the best treatment plan.

restoril,8,"restoril insomnia - I need to take this medication a few nights in a row which seems to get my sleep cycle back in sync.  After a few nights of sound sleep I can fall asleep quickly without the need for medication.  My mind is able to stop its endless racing/ I have noticed that if I do not give myself at least eight hours of sleep time this medicaiton will cause me to be very groggy in the morning.  I will have a difficult time awakening and getting myself moving.  Others tell me I look like a zombie!  So I know it's important to take the Rx w/in 15 minutes of lying awake in bed & not let too much time go by before I lose the 8 hours of sleeptime. I have found the best way to take this medication (once I've had a few nights of my mind racing & not being able to fall asleep) is to take 30 mg. a half hour before bedtime which causes a drowsy feeling even before falling into bed.  A few ights of this procedure & my sleep cycle seems to get back on track & then I don't need the medication, until  another cycle of sleeplessness creeps into my life!",high

It makes me less tolerant of heat, sun. I have a problem with this anyway, and when the dose was increased from 800 mg/d to 1200 mg/d, I came near to heat stroke when outside. I was put on this by Rheumatology, 12 years ago. Dose was 800 mg/d until spring of 2007, I asked for it to be increased.

Because it specifically treats the stomach there were no side effects to any other part of my body.

meridia,8,"meridia weight loss - Meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also, it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body! At first I felt increased nervousness and anxiety.  After about ten days, it lifted my mood and began to take away my appetite.  Then the nervousness went away.  It is harder for me to fall asleep and to sleep as deeply as before, but some of this happens when ever I loose weight. Take first thing in the morning with breakfast.  I eat three meals with two snacks a day and drink loads of water and iced tea.  You have to drink enough for this drug to work.  You need WAY more water, as much as possible.  then you really will feel full most of the time.",high
acyclovir,10,acyclovir shingles - The benefits were that the medication lessened the time and the severity I believe of the shingles outbreak. I did not notice any side effects while taking the medication. I was given the medication later than I should have been becuase the first doctor that I went to said that I was having an allergic reaction to something and gave me a persription for an anti-itch cream.

I was diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. I was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. I had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. My nausea all but disappeared. I only became nauseated when working nights. My anxiety level also somewhat decreased. I was very sleepy at first and would sleep up to 14 hours per day. I was also recovering from mono at the time, which may have contributed to my drowsiness. I felt a bit dazed at first as well. I took 15mg once a day at bedtime as it causes drowsiness and it could be increased to 30 mg although I never needed an increase. I took remeron to get rid of my nausea which was constant and severe and it worked. After 3 years I had a major crisis in my life and forgot to take my remeron for 4 days in a row. When I finally did take it I was incredibly tired and couldn't keep my eyes open all day. I felt stoned and the only factor that had changed had been the remeron. I decided to try stopping as I had not suffered from that severe nausea since starting remeron. It has been 2 months and the nausea has not yet returned. I have no other side effects.",high
prozac,9,"prozac depression - My mood was stablized, and I was able to take advantage of cognitive therapy.  Without the medication, I was not able to benefit from CT. Mild sexual dysfunction;  nothing else. I took 20 mg. of Prozac once per day, in one tablet.  It took about 6 weeks for the drug to reach its peak effectiveness, which is one of the drawbacks of this anti-depressant therapy.  I tried others, but they didn't work nearly as well as Prozac.",high
prinivil,9,"prinivil hypertension - My historically ""high moderate"" or borderline high blood pressure (140/90 or 150/100) has been brought to normal (110/70 or 120/80) so that further, more aggressive treatment is unnecessary. I have noticed my sex drive is somewhat reduced; I am perhaps slightly more tired in the afternoons than I was before taking the Lisinopril. I take one tablet in the morning.",high
nexium,8,"nexium acute peptic ulcer - Antacids were ineefeective to counteract severe pain and inability to eat. Symptoms reduced within 24 hours and completely dissapeared within 3 days None Acute ulcer was the result of diclofenac sodium taken for the aches and fever. very severe ulceration,pain required tramadole administration. Inability to eat. Antacids were ineffective nexium resolved the symptoms within 48 hours.",high
elidel,8,elidel rashes - helped to prevent flare by arresting inflammation at the beginning of condition. it was in a cream formulation which made it easy to penetrate skin and ideal for a tropical climate. it was however not useful when the condition- eczema or dermatitis flared up. it is more useful in controlling inflammation at the beginning as opposed to a strong steroid cream used more as a rescue when condition has already flared and has become red and angry. none at 1st sign of pink and itchiness use sparingly and apply emollients over. Once inflammation has seized stop Elidel but continue emollients to help rebuild skin barrier function.,high
omnicef,2,"omnicef strep throat - This drug worked as a treatment for strep throat. Behavioral changes including extreme irritability and aggressiveness. While these changes started while taking Omnicef, they continued for months afterward. My daughter also developed food sensitivities. From careful observation, I surmise that this drug caused severe inflammation in her gut that we are treating with probiotics. We are seeing some improvement with avoiding foods such as milk and egg as well as diligently taking probiotics and vitamin c.",Low
proair-hfa,8,"proair-hfa asthma flares - I was able to breathe more freely after I took this medication and my peak flow meter readings were significantly higher. I did not notice any side effects. However, unless I positioned the inhaler very carefully, some of the medication ended up in my mouth rather than being inhaled. I was also using a Q-Var inhaler twice a day during the flare (I normally use it once a day.) My treatment regimen when I have a flare is Q-var at 2 puffs twice a day, and the ProAir inhaler 2 puffs every four hours.",high
flexeril,8,"flexeril muscle spasms - Muscle relaxation took about 2 days to be effective.  Pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially, but after 2 days relief was found. 4 days was far better and 6-7 stopped taking every day. Drowsiness was an issue, but this did improve the sleep time which reduced stress and allowed blood pressure to lower.  I do not like to take medicine, but I can see how easy it is to rely on these to feel relaxed and numb!  It is frightening when I hear about people taking these every night and not think about treating underlying cause of muscle tension. The two medicines were used in tandem to offset the excrutiating pain in neck and shoulders due to muscles spasms. Chiropractic care was also used, but the pain was equivalent to childbirth contractions and after two days of no sleep and increased stress, medicine was sought.  The medicine took another two days to offer relief that allowed sleep, but after 4 days the muscles were relaxed. Chiropactic care continued and yoga was restarted to resolve the underlying problems. After 6-7 days medication was stopped. 1 night of the following week required medication, but since, none needed.",high
differin,7,"differin acne - Smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a Vitamin A derivative and promote faster cell turnover. My skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too. Skin sensitivity can increase if you use too much of the product. When it says apply a thin layer, it means a very small amount - it goes a long way! For me this  was the only real side effect. Treatment is simple - after cleansing the face gently, apply a thin layer of the Differin gel to the skin before applying anything else, in other words it should go underneath any moisturiser or any other product you are using so that it is in direct contact with the skin.",high
prevacid,5,"prevacid acid reflux - Taken daily, Prevacid successfully reduced my acid stomach symptoms to the point that they did not occur. I did not need other over the counter remedies I had used in the past, such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared. Unfortunately, I became woozy and suffered dizziness after taking the medication, often requiring that I lie down and or take a nap. After an initial period of a few hours, these symptoms subsided. Side effects were sporadic and I tried initially to continue the medication due to its effectiveness. Prevacid was prescribed for my symptoms of acid reflux, which included some stomach  upset and ""full"" feeling after eating.  Although it was highly effective, I eventually discontinued use of Prevacid due to side effects.  I am now using over the counter Zantac successfully, only as needed, not daily. It should be noted that I am very sensitive to medication and often react to medications that are not a problem for others.",high
vyvanse,8,vyvanse add - High concentration and staying focused.  It took away my irratibility & aggitation. I feel very calm. I felt that It help extremely with all my ADD symptoms except that I felt depressed. If that makes sense. Weight loss. Teeth Clenching for the first week. Scalp picking and chewing the inside of my cheeks. Very depressed. A little jittery. This is a great medication for ADD. I've never felt so together in my adult life. My Doctor doesn't want me to take it anymore because of my side effects. I'm so upset that I had side effects on this med because I loved how it worked.,high
effexor-xr,9,"effexor-xr depression/anxiety - Helped with being able to feel more comfortable interacting in social settings.
Helped with being able to complete daily chores and activities. Also besides getting my daily chores accomplished I have more desire to attend social events and have picked up a few hobbies. Increased my overall since of happiness and positive outlook on life. At first I had trouble sleeping until my body adjusted to the medication.
I have more vivid dreams. Also has caused me to talk in my sleep and sometimes physically act out the dream while asleep. One night I was dreaming I was swimming and woke me and my boyfriend up because I was kicking my legs as if I were swimming. If I miss a dose and go to sleep it causes night sweats. If I miss a dose before bed I wake up with my clothes and hair soaked in sweat. I was started at 37.5mg for a week. Moved up to 75mg the next week. After a week at 75mg was then moved up to 150mg. I was then moved up a week later to 250mg. I took 250mg for about 2yrs. I had to cut back on the dose because I lost my job with insurance and could no longer afford 250mg prescriptions.
I tried to (without my doctors advice or knowledge) get off the medicine cold turkey when I lost my insurance. Doing that made me extremely emotional. I would start crying for no reason at all and felt crazy! I went back to the doctor and talked about my situation. She set up a program to slowly take me off the medicine. I stepped down my dose by 75mg every 2 weeks till I got to 75mg. Then I went to taking 37.5 for 2 weeks. Then went to 37.5 every other day for a week. Then 37.5 every third day and so on till I finally got down to none. I went 6 months off the medication before going back to the doctor to be put back on it. I have now been back on it for about a year now. I have no plans to ever stop taking it again.",high
wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl depression - Helped with depression - did nothing for anxiety I did help me with my fear of crowds. It also helped me with my hopelessness I had been encountering. Anxiety - Seemed to make me nervous and to make me irritable at times. It did not, however, decrease my appetite which is does for many people who take it. Given for major depression.  One 150mg pill per day.  I still take the same dosage as I started out on.  I am afraid to up my dose because Wellbutrin can cause seizures in many people.",high

nexium,8,"nexium heart burn - Nexium  is very effective for me when I want to relieve heartburn. I don't take it everyday, only when I have the symptoms of heartburn due to acid reflux.  The treatment benefits were that my stomach felt better, and I didn't have acid reflux due to the foods I had ingested. I did not experience any symptoms. The way I use Nexium is I take it every time a food doesn't sit well and causes acid reflux or I feel it'll cause  I take it.",high
kenalog,2,"kenalog acne - I saw a moderate decrease of inflammation in some cystic acne lesions.  In the case of mild acne that is not cystic, the risks outweigh the benefits if the injection is not done properly. I developed a prominent indentation on my face at one injection site.  This was caused by lipothrophy, or a shrinkage of the fat cells beneath my skin.  This usually resolves within 2-4 weeks.  Sometimes it never goes away completely.  I have also been unusually irritable and anxious. A dermatological assistant injected what she assumed to be several adult acne cysts on my face with an unknown amount of Kenalog 10.  About a week after one injection site developed an indentation the size of a pencil eraser. On a subsequent follow up visit the doctor told me that this would go away in two to four weeks.  In two weeks, I have seen no improvement.  I feel that the docor did not adequately explain the possible physical and emotional side effects of this very potent drug.  She never said that it was a steroid.",Low
zithromax,1,"zithromax bronchitis - I didn't receive any treatment benefits from this drug.  It actually made the symptoms worse with more resistance to antibiotics.

Gained the ability to remember things from conversations to classwork. Hair loss.  Weight loss, which is nice at first but changes to malnourishment after a few years.  Relationships changed because I was no longer able to be manipulated. 1/2 in the AM.  1/2 after lunch",high
niaspan,8,"niaspan high lpa - Niaspan definitely works to lower lpa.  I understand that high lpa cause plaque build up in the arteries.  According to my cardiologist, high levels of lpa cause ""skinny people to have heart attacks"".  My levels were in the 70's and the normal range ends at 30.  After taking Niaspan for a few weeks, my lpa was within normal limits. Flushing with skin burning was the main side effect of taking 1000 mg of Niapsan per day.  The cardiologist suggested taking a baby aspirin one halp hour before taking the Niaspan.  This does eliminate most of the flushing side effects and skin burning.  I highly recommend everyone with a family history of heart problems to get a blood test for lpa. 1000 mg a day - once a day  Cardiologist wanted me to take up to 1,500 mg but 1,000 mg brought my lpa back into range.  My blood lpa test came back in the 70 range and normal limit is up to 30.  After taking 1000 mg, I was back in the normal lpa range.  Everyone with a family history of heart attacks or high cholesterol should have an lpa blood test run in order to prevent possible plaque buildup.",high
protonix,7,"protonix gerd - Reduced excess acid and throat irritation, although not completely. Bending over still causes bile in throat.  Nighttime coughing still happens. Certain foods definitely trigger irritation.  Protonix was the last of 3 or 4 similar medications I tried (Nexium, etc) and all others had much worse side effects (headaches and dry mouth particularly). Mild nausea at first, gradually disappearing after about a month of treatment. basically 1 pill in the AM and avoid triggering foods such as chocolate.  Fortunately food triggers seem to be time-of-day sensitive. For instance, I can drink coffee but only in the AM.",high
elavil,10,"elavil migraines - I had fewer headaches and the headaches which I did have were less severe and easier to relieve with medication. I have fewer days off from work and can enjoy life with family and friends without worrying about headaches. I experience an increase in headache severity after taking the medication as well as nausea and light sensitivity. But I only have to take 1 pill, tolerate the increase in symptoms for about 1/2 hour and my headache is gone. And, I don't have the headache hangover I used to have with other medications. I take a daily medication at bedtime (amitriptyline) which reduces the frequency of my headaches (significantly!) and then I take Axert when I do get a migraine headache.",high

effexor,5,effexor depression - I'm not entirely sure it was effective at all. It was really difficult to quite taking Effexor.  I had all kinds of panic attacks and severe depression when trying to quite.  I must have tried to quite a dozen times.  I think this is a dangerous drug. I took Effexor once daily at bedtime for 3 years.,high
tramadol,10,"tramadol post-surgical pain - Eliminated the pain without the mental side effects of drugs like Vicodin. Seemed to be a very mild mood elevator, but that could just have been due to having my mood improved from not being in pain. For the first couple days of taking it I suffered moderate insomnia/waking up during the night. This went away over the course of treatment. After surgery, I was offered Vicodin or Percocet but do not like either because they cause me to be too foggy mentally. I initially tried just Advil but that didn't work on the pain. The Dr. prescribed generic Ultram (Tramadol). It took quite awhile for the first one to take effect (more than an hour) but it provided long-lasting pain relief. I was a bit leery of it because I read online that it can be addictive however, after 3 weeks I cut the dose to 1x a day instead of 2x and then after 4 weeks stopped entirely with no ill effects after that.",high
retin-a,7,"retin-a aging skin - I noticed an accelerated skin cell turn over with the peeling and new skin coming through which is brighter and younger looking. With the combination of the Obagi skin care, my skin also became uniform in color overall and the darker or brown spots faded which helps to make my skin look even better.  I don't have much wrinkles to speak of except minimal ones around the eye area and laugh lines around the mouth which I did not notice any change or improvement on that.  Pimples after an initial phase of getting worst got better and during the monthly period is lesser than before treatment. Definite improvement on that! Itching, peeling, irritated skin. Appearance of pimples on the shoulder and back of the neck if I apply Retin A on that area. Retin A applied with the Obagi skincare products at night before going to bed.

retin-a,8,"retin-a sun damage to skin - Retin-A smoothed out my skin and reduced fine lines. It particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  They virtually disappeared, and people remarked within a few months that I looked healthier, less tired, and younger.  I was happy with the results of using this product. Irritated skin, dry skin. When I first started using this product, they gave me a weaker strength and I gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  The only problem was that if I used a little too much, even later as my skin was used to the formula, I would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.  I eventually moved to using topical ascorbic acid instead of Retin-A, which works well and doesn't cause the skin irritation. I spread a dab or two of the cream on my face at night before sleeping.  It took several weeks to acclimate to the cream. It did improve the appearance of my skin. I noticed that it also made what the dermatologist called pre-cancerous spots disappear (these were a couple of small spots that the doctor wanted to treat with topical vitamin A).",high
citalopram,9,"citalopram insomnia - I did notice right away a marked improvement in my insomnia and no longer require the clonazepam.  I too felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and my disposition improved.  I felt much better than I had in years.  Little aches and pains in my lower back and hips which I've been treating throught the chiropractor, became more tolerable.  My husband was pleased and thinks I'm much easier to live with.  I didn't realize how grouchy and difficult I had become. I have trouble waking and getting up in the morning.  My lips are very dry and nothing seems to help.  My mouth is also dry first thing in the morning, but improves as the day progresses.  I yawn excessively.  I don't have as much energy, I have to force myself to take an evening walk. Dr initially told me he thought my insomnia was depression.  I was desparate.  The sleep deprivation was making it hard to function at work and home.  I agreed to take 20 mg of citalopram.  My insomnia didn't completely subside, so I still was taking clonazepam .5 mg about every other night.  After a month, the dr upped the prescription to 40 mg.  I slowly made the transition from 20 to 30 then 40 mg.",high

I know it sounds strange, but I couldn't focus at work or concentrate.  The worst of all, I started having strange pain in my knees and hips that, I had not felt before.  It was not my ususal pain.  I had foot cramps, couldn't sleep real well. I had extreme hot flashes each day, however, those were tolerable. I am only praying that this will all go away.

I lowered my dosage and live the sound sleep.  it knocked out my delusions and hallucinations, hopefully for good. weight gain is the worst side effect, but a small price to pay for sanity. I actually ended up with motion disorders from all the other meds, the worst one being parkinsons for over a year.  I had to take parkinsons drugs.

It was very hard to wake up even after having drak 12 ounces of coffee.  Throughout the day my mind had an empty feeling that made it hard to jump start my responsiblties.

retin-a,10,"retin-a acne - Face cleared up in weeks.About 3 mths. I started in the end of November and by mid February my face was extremely clear. I stop using it after my face cleared up, WRONG THING TO DO. Once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear. I got a whole lot of bumps on my face from using heavy amount of retin-a on my face. You only need to use a little to get the job done. It's very strong and needs to be put on very lightly on the bumps. Excessive retin-a will cause you to look worse! I love rein-a only because it grabs everything from underneath the surface and brings it out. It really works but takes time and patience. I would always stick to retin-a and never change because it gets the job done and theres no turning back.",high
flagyl,5,"flagyl tooth abscess - It cured my tooth abscess, even though Ampicillin had failed to cure it. Severe Nausea, occasional vomiting, feeling very tired and lethargic. Doctor prescribed this for me as I had a tooth abscess of a few weeks duration.  I had previously been prescribed Ampicillin 500mg 3 times a day for it, this resulted in a lessening of the abscess for a few days and then its return as bad as ever.  Started taking the Flagyl and it made me feel lousy.  Nauseous, vomiting, feeling as if I had the flu.  Discovered that the side effects lessened if I ate something substantial (especially dairy products) before taking it.  I was determined to persevere to get rid of the abscess.  This did not begin to subside until the fourth day of treatment, but it did go completely by the seventh day and has not returned.  This was one month ago.

percocet,6,"percocet pain/headaches - Was effective in treating pain. That is all it was used for. Severe Itching, Insomnia, Nausea, Vomiting. The Nausea and Vomiting would often last through the next day. All in all, it was effective, but not worth taking for the side effects.

clonazepam,4,"clonazepam anxiety/insomnia/ - I took it when my husband of 30 years left me and my 4 kids for another woman.  I couldn't sleep, eat or function.  The klonopin helped me sleep, which helped me function. I probably would have committed suicide without it. I first noticed that I had trouble memorizing things.  It was the trouble with equilibrium and balance that motivated me to get off of it.  I got to the point where I was a little unsteady walking with flats.  I also had morning grogginess, which would gradually get better by lunch time. It was hard weaning off because of the insomnia that insued.

I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep. It did make me mildly nauseous for the first day that I was on it. After that, all good.  It made my hands very shaky for awhile, but that seems to have subsided for the most part, particularly since I cut my caffeine intake.  Given that it's an amphetamine derivative, it make since that adding another stimulant might lead to side effects.

Also, out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994, I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned, so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return. Basically no side effects that I have noticed.  Possibly slightly decreased sex drive but nothing compared to other depression medications I have taken.  Does not cause weight gain, and may actually cause minimal weight loss.  Supposedly may act as stimulant so recommended to take in the a.m.  I have noticed maybe slight stimulant effect. I pill daily.  I take the medication in the a.m.",high
retin-a-micro,8,"retin-a-micro acne - The benefits were that the bumps under my skin did gradually get smaller and go away.  They stayed away as long as i continued to use the product.  An unexpected benefit was the my skin had a nice glow to it, like i had come from a facial and my skin was smoother, after using it for some time. The side effects were dryness in some areas and peeling, even when not using it, a few days later i would peel. But just flaky, not terrible and no redness. I started by applying a small amount every other night before bed, but since i was peeling a lot and saw results i started using less frequently.",high
restasis,10,"restasis dry eyes - Restasis helps with tear related problems:  dryness, reflex overtearing, mucous discharge, irritated eyes, redness and lid swelling.  It can irritate at the initial time of therapy but with extra artificial tears this effect is lessoned. some people get prolonged stinging for 5 to 10 minutes and occasionally increased redness and lid swelling maintainence for chronic dry eye and sometimes helpful for blepharitis as well.",high
prempro,2,"prempro menopausal symptoms - Reduction of hot flashes and night sweats. Constant heavy bleeding that was not controlled on lower dose of progestins.  When the progestins were increased, the bleeding tapered off but insomnia became a major issue.  Some increased fluid retention in the hands and feet. Breast tenderness. Patient began to experience menopausal symptoms in early 40s.  Prempro was prescribed by physician to treat hot flashes, sleep disturbances, and signs of early vaginal atrophy.  When heavy vaginal bleeding continued to be problematic, hgher doses of progestins were tried.  The result was increasing severity of the sleep disturbances although the vaginal bleeding subsided.  After the patient developed FMS, Prempro was discontinued by another physician and the patient placed on bioidentical hormones.  Breast tenderness subsided and sleep patterns improved.  Patient later developed bladder cancer, although no familial or behavioral risk factors were present.",Low
vicodin,10,"vicodin cesarean - I chose to take vicodin instead of an ibuprofin based pain killer because my holistic doctor believes ibuprofin  slows healing time. For me, vicodin has literally no noticable side effects, of course I only took a limited amount for acute pain, which was relieved 100%. I felt no palpable side effects. I also was very cautious to take no more than what I needed, not only because it can be habit forming but because it can cause constipation which was the last thing I wanted! I was instructed to take every eight hours however I found that I only needed a half pill and subsequently only took three pills, actually I took two and a half and stoll felt no pain.",high
lipitor,10,"lipitor high cholesterol - lowered total blood cholesterol levels. In particular, my LDL (low cholesterol) was lowered significantly, while HDL (good cholesterol) was elevated. There were no negative side effects of this treatment the cholesterol lowering medication (Lipitor) is taken once a day at bedtime. It was recommended that a full glass of water be taken with administration of each tablet of Lipitor. In addition, blood tests are required every 4 to 6 months to test liver functions.",high
chantix,2,"chantix quit smoking - I didn't feel the urge as much as I did before the medication, but they were still there. Nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams I built up the dosage like I was supposed to and took the twice daily dose for two days.  I spent both of those days unable to move because of the nausea, so my doctor recommended I drop down to .5 mg a day. On that small dosage I became very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts as well as very vivid dreams.  I went off the drug and then tried it again a few months later only to have the same depression issues. I'd rather keep smoking and try to find a new way to quit than to lose my life on this drug.",Low
cipro,1,"cipro uti - NONE Insomnia, back pain, muscle pain and cramping everywhere especially my legs, joint pain in knees ankles fingers, throat swelling, throbbing and sharp pains behind my knees, heavy feeling in my legs like i was dragging them severe anxiety like i kept picturing myself dying and the poisen running threw my veins(yes creepy) and for about five minutes i was lying in bed and my limbs felt too heavy to move like i was paralized. I will never take this TOXIC excuse for a medicine again in my life and i will tell everyone i know to demand another option. This stuff is pure poison. Went to the doctor today said i was having adverse reactions and sent me home with a new perscription although seemed to not fully believe my symptoms were real which I can assure u all they were and ARE! I am afraid of long term effects and this was only after ONE 500 mg dose! This is truly terrifying stuff",Low
prometrium,9,"prometrium menopausal symptoms - Prometrium is a form of progesterone that helps ameliorate some common menopausal symptoms, including insomnia. No noticeable side effects were apparent with this medication. The daily dosage was one 100mg. capsule, taken at bedtime. There were no ""rest days"" with this form of HRT. An annual blood test was recommended, to ensure liver health.",high
lorazepam,10,"lorazepam insomnia, anxiety - I go to sleep within an hour and a half of taking it. I even get up to use the toilet around 4 am and I have no problem falling back asleep. Tried Ambien for 6 months, but I had to keep upping the dose and I still couldn't sleep. Plus Ambien made my anxiety worse. Now my anxiety is gone and I am generally more content with life. ""I can sweat the small stuff"", if you know what I mean. I did start Prozac about the same time. I haven't had any at all, even if I miss a night which is rare. My mornings are slow, but than again I've never been a ""morning person"". One cup of tea and I'm good to go. I take 1 mg before bed. My natural path doctor recomended Lorazepam after a horrible experience with Effexsor. I also that 20 mg of Prozac at night also.",high
asacol,6,"asacol crohns disease - Less flair ups of the crohns disease. Less diarhea and cramping. no side effects evidentent I believe you mean the treatment of the disease. For me it was taking my medication Asacol, and watching my diet. I understand foods have different effects on different individuals. For me, avoiding foods high in fat, avoiding excessive sugars and high fiber foods (popcorn, nuts) made the difference for me. The drug w/o diet would not work.

Should stress be factored, that too, weighed heavily.",high
zoloft,7,"zoloft depression - Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them. The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions. My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place.",high
provera,7,"provera endometrial hyperplasia - the benefits were, I was taking it for excessive prolong spotting and bleeding. Slowly but surely everything did go back to normal, no more excessive bleeding or spotting but it did take like 8 months. the side effect for me was weight gain and depression. Treatment was to be ongoing for six months to treat condition. I was to take it 10 days out of the month. During treatment I had break-through bleeding and very bad cramping, though I do not think directly connected with treatment. I gained weight, but soon took off through walking running and other activities. I went through a very bad depression, resulting in me taking another medication for treament of that. It wasn't until I went off treatment until everything got back to ""normal"" (no more excessive bleeding or spotting in between periods).",high
propecia,1,"propecia hair loss - Hair Regrowth I experienced extreme fatigue, anxiety, depression, gynecomastia, apathy, anorgasma, penile fibrosis, penile numbness, loss of nighttime erections and endless hormonal imbalances.	

I took this drug for 1 year and 4 months. The anxiety and depression affected me almost immediately although I was completely clueless as to the cause. I cycled through every single anti-depressant and ADHD medication trying to solve this problem. It wasn't until I stopped the medication that I realized it was the Propecia. THESE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED AT ALL SEVEN MONTHS LATER! I would not wish this on my worst enemy. This drug has literally destroyed my life. I know that no one wants to lose their hair and look unattractive, but just imagine how attractive you will be if you are one of the unfortunate few of us that gets gynecomastia, penile fibrosis, and inability to ejaculate (I CANNOT EVEN MASTRUBATE TO ORGASM after taking this drug). If you value your life then I strongly suggest you find some other way! 1 pill per day",Low
remicade,10,"remicade psoriatic arthritis - This drug has helped the pain and swelling in my hands and back from psoriatic arthritis. My fingers were also starting to twist, and this has helped to slow that down. The psoriasis on my skin has almost gone completely away. About a week or two before time for the next dose, a little comes back, but nothing like it used to be. I don't notice any side effects. I go in to the office for an inter venous infusion every 8 weeks for two hours at a time.",high
maxalt,10,"maxalt migraine - Maxalt relieved all the typical symptoms of a migraine within half an hour and i could keep going with my day where as before nothing would help. Topamax is my preventative but i still get the occasional that will push through and thats when i use the Maxalt, hence why only afew times a month. slight fatigue and drowsiness but not enough to make me go to sleep. I take one 10mg wafer when i feel it coming as when it is past the point it doesnt work. Never needed to take 2",high
singulair,9,"singulair asthma - Helped keep asthma under control.  Didn't cause side effects.  Was easy to administer.  Provided the outcomes we had hoped for.   Pleasant taste. After hearing there were behavioral side effects, I was concerned that my child might experience the same.  There were no noticeable side effects. Child takes a 4 mg chewable tablet daily to prevent ashtma attacks.  Previously, she used the granules which we mixed with applesauce or yogurt for her to eat.  Very easy administration.  Pleasant taste in the chewable.",high
lumigan,4,"lumigan eyelash growth - The upper and lower eyelashes grew longer, thicker, and darker.  There is less need for mascara or eyelash curlers with this product.  Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work. I developed dark under eye circles, itching, redness and a slight headache after each use but I was told that the under eye circles and headaches I experienced were less common side effects.  Once the treatment was stopped all of the side effects disappeared including the dark under eye circles. Also, once the treatment is stopped the eyelashes eventually return to their original state. I was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  It is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  I used a new eyelash brush daily and Latisse contains once a day applicators.",Low
retin-a,8,"retin-a acne, anti-aging - The retin-a seems to have minimized some of my fine lines, and has helped clear my pores, greatly reduced blackheads and minimized white-heads, and almost erradicated cystic blemishes altogether.  I believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results I have seen thust far. I have been fortunate to have only experienced minimal irritation.  Initially, I had tightness, dry feeling on my face, with some peeling or shedding.  This subsequently caused some itching, but, again, no irritation or pain.  I noticed when applied to active blemishes, the blemish seemed to worsen, become redder,and seemed like it wouldn't heal, but I have combated that by adding a good, natural moisturizer into my routine after the application. I started using .05 % retina-a every evening after cleansing, but making sure my face was completely dry.  Only a small amount of the cream was needed.  I applied it carefully, avoiding lips and inner eye area.  Afterwards, I used a non-greasy, non-comedogenic moisturizer to minimize dryness, flaking and irritation.",high
claritin,9,"claritin indoor allergies - I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds. It ended my year long depression. Please see above.",high
avita,6,"avita aging wrinkles - I feel that my skin is smoother, and hopefully the wrinkles will not get deeper as quickly as not doing anything. The side effects were mild.  Seemed to be a lot of skin flaking/peeling at first. I find a burning sensation if I am in direct sun so try and avoid that. The treatment was mainly to help keep the ageing spots on my face to a minimum and to try and prevent my wrinkles from getting worse.  I have found that daily use of exfoliating sheets and using an Olay thermal mini-peel or similar abrasion cream, I can keep the skin flaking under control.  I have to be careful out in the sun so I do use a sunscreen as well as a sunscreen powder make-up so that my skin doesn't tingle.",high
provera,5,"provera heavy menses - It did control my periods.  Other benefits included a mild feeling of well being and return to health. spotting, some mild depression, not unlike PMS symptoms when younger.  There was some cramping and some spotting. following an episode of a 2 month long period with episodes of very heavy flow, doctor prescribed the Provera to regulate period until menopause resulted in the cessation of menses.",high

Unable to concentrate, sleeplessness, dizzyness, very dry mouth, continuous clenching of teeth, all my joints painful. Have now been taking off the drug as my GP thinks I have an intolerence of the drug of which I told them off in the first instance. Feel worse now than I did initially as now so tired and unable to hold down my job, or in fact function in any positive way at all right now. Further advised that if I still feel depressed in a couple of weeks they will try prozac!",Low
wellbutrin,8,"wellbutrin depression - Alleviated depression without lethargy, weight gain, a paradoxical effect, or sexual dysfunction.  Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking. I often would get pounding headaches, in the front of my skull and at the sides, especially as the day wore on.  I also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day, which would be exacerbated by coffee.  I got tremors. Occasionally I'd get migaines. I took 2 100 mg of the Wellbutrin, 20mg of Ritalin and a 10 mg of a beta blocker (I can't remember the name) in the morning.  Then at 3 I took the other 200 mg of the Wellbutrin; at night I took the Serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the Trazodone.  I took a drug holiday from the Ritalin over the weekend, but over the years I eventually increased the dosage to 35mg of Ritalin in the morning.",high

innofem,10,"innofem cold chills and hot flashes - Estradiol has almost completely eliminated the alternating cold chills and hot flashes that I was experiencing.

I take one tablet (1 mg) of Estradiol daily, at bedtime.",high
adipex-p,7,"adipex-p obesity - Helped me concentrate, did help curb appetite, made me feel younger (more energy), thinking more clearly. Could not sleep - slept for maybe 4 hours a night, but even that was ""light"" sleep.  Horrible headaches the morning after I took it until I took another one.  Also had to keep my temper in check, had what seemed like mild ""roid rage"".  I was also nauseated every morning when I woke up (not pregnant and don't drink). 37.5 mg once per day.

mobic,10,"mobic arthritis - Pain reduction, increased mobility and range of motion.  The difference between how I feel with and without Mobic is astonishing.  Unfortunately, if I take this drug for more than six months straight, it begins to lose effectiveness.  Thus, I now save it for situations where I absolutely need it:  travel, sports, etc. None.  My only complaint is that it loses effectiveness when taken over a period of time. Took once a day, always with food to protect my stomach.",high

Vaginal irritation, decreased sexual desire, constant yeast infections Within the first two weeks that I started using Nuvaring my sexual desire decreased and it became very difficult to get aroused.  This had never happened to me before and as soon as I stopped using the ring it became easier to get aroused.  I also had constant yeast infections while taking this drug.  Before I started Nuvaring I had never in my life had one.  While on it, I must have had at least six.  I have been off of the ring now for three months and have not had one.  Although I have seen few people make this claim, I swear that there is a connection.",high

During treatment for the headaches with frova and ketorolac I had an episode where I had sudden and severe pain in my head and felt like my head was going to explode, which sent me to the emergency room. The cause was never really determined but in the process it was noticed that my blood pressure was elevated and remained elevated during following doctor visits.  Since being on toprol, the headaches and blood pressure have remained managable throughout monthly hormonal changes.",high
locoid-lipocream,3,"locoid-lipocream nummular eczema - Unfortunately this did nothing to heal the skin. It was an expensive experiment for the doctor to misdiagnose my condition, which was not sever but had been present for 9+ months. Eventually I was switched to fluocinonide, which seemed to do only a little better. No real assistance or side efects were noticed. Treatment was applied to affected areas on both legs twice daily for 2 weeks.",Low

Often before taking the medication I would just feel that it's impossible to get organized, to stick to the job at hand, or keep an appointment. Daily tasks of getting up and ready for the day's work, getting to work on time, and being productive at work were difficult. Appetite seems to fluctuate, usually being low during the middle of the day and more normal by suppertime. Adequate amounts of food that is nutritional seem to be especially helpfull.

Appetite seems to fluctuate, usually being low during the middle of the day and more normal by suppertime. Adequate amounts of food that is nutritional seem to be especially helpfull. I was told that in prescribing for an adult, special considerations are made. The adult may need less of the medication for his weight. A medication may have a longer ""half-life"" in an adult. We started with 19mg and worked up to 36mg. That seemed to be the correct dosage.",high
mobic,8,"mobic arthritis pain - Patient had a marked decrease in pain due to arthritis. Joint pain significantly decreased. Joint stiffness decreased a little.

zyban,10,"zyban smoking cessation - The drug did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It completely eliminated all nicotine cravings leaving only the psychological aspect to worry about.  So if I kept myself busy, the thought of smoking would never even enter my mind. For the first week or so, I was slightly hyperactive and had some trouble sleeping.  That problem went away with some adjustment in the time I took the drug as well as with my bodies assimilation of the drug.  I also had a mildly bad taste in my mouth.  That too faded away. I expressed to my doctor a desire to try this drug to quit smoking.  She prescribed it to me and I began taking it shortly thereafter.  Before my 2 week quit date had even arrived, I noticed a marked decrease in nicotine withdrawl episodes.  I just didn't need to smoke.  I found I was started to smoke only when I thought I ""should"" - after dinner, right before bed and other habitual times.  Once I stopped smoking all together, it was a relief to only have to battle my habits and not the withdrawl effects of nicotine as well.",high
nuvaring,7,"nuvaring birth control - I did not need to take a pill everyday. There were less side effects compared to the amount in other birth controls. My painful cramps went away.

I had palpitations, nausea, uncontrolable shaking, severe headache and felt strangely detatched from the world (it was as if I was watching the world through a dense fog). This was my Psychiatrist and GP`s last hope of treating my depression with medication, and I was told that I probably would suffer no adverse effects (""very rare"", apparently).

topamax,7,"topamax migraine - My conclusions of the medication are that it has definately lessened the amount of migraine headaches that I was encountering. I have not had to have an emergency hospital visit in almost a year. This went from a visit occuring almost every other month with horrible painful headaches in between this time. I still get headaches which are tollerable, and if I have a migraine have not had to go to the hospital for pain relief. It has been tolerable. I have now gotten my dose down to 15mg at night time only and am still having the same benefit. My only side effect were some memory difficulty in the beginning. I drove to my doctors office and became disoriented. Rather than panic I laughed it off and pulled over and had to think about where I was going.
It has definately had a positive influence on the migraines. It seems to have some sort of effect on eating though. I did loose a bit more weight which I did not need to loose, but now have been able to be back at my normal weight. Some forgetfulness,, tiredness at onset.

My doctor advised that there is no risk in taking the medication long term, so I plan to continue its prophylactic effect. Dry nasal passages are the major side effect.  This is no so bad, since I use a nasal moisturizer to help with this side effect.  I do notice that when I take singular at bedtime I experience tingling in my legs, and when I don't take it, there is none...so this may be a possible side effect.  I experience dry lips, but not sure if that is a result of taking singular. Not sure what this means...I am surprised and happy with prevention of allergy symptoms.  I see my allergist once a year to be sure that it is safe and can be taken with other meds.

The skin became thinner in appearance and more and more dry. It seemed to be harming my skin. At that point my dermotologist said my skin may be too sensitive. I do not feel that I have sensitive skin because while I may have a pale color skin, it has a olive tone. I do not sunburn very easily. Then I switched to ROC but had similar results. Dry and thinning skin. I followed the directions which were to increase it gradually.

My life has changed with Advair, I highly recommend it! When I first started it, I noticed a little bit of nervousness, this only lasted a few days, and with continued use, I am no longer having any side effects.

I didnt think I had adverse effects from it until someone pointed out my dry constant cough. I developed a dry cough and it seemed to get persistently worse as months went by. I didnt realize the cough could be a side effect from the drug, but as soon as I replaced it with Benicar, the symptons disappeared.

Vicodin and Ibuprofin were prescribed together for the management of pain.

Dry mouth (which is great because I now drink a lot of water instead of sodas because the sodas don't quinch my thirst) I have been on antidepression meds for 15 years, but my depression persisted regardless of the treatment.  I used to sleep 12-16 hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago, but even sleeping with CPAP did not help with my daytime fatigue.  After seeing MANY family practitioners, I finally broke down and INVESTED in a very well educated Psychiatrist who diagnoed me with ADD since childhood.  His decision to prescribe Vyvanse was brilliant!  I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head, and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive, but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12-hour work days.  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level, but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent, and I no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis, and if Adult ADD is what you have, then give Vyvanse a try.  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better.  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!  You MUST take it when you awaken for your day, because it takes about 12-15 hours to get out of your system.  If you take it later in the day - you will experaince insomnia.

This wore off after 6-8 weeks. Relieved my symptoms of  Interstitial Cystitis significantly after 1 year or so on the drug.  Even within 3 months it greatly reduced the pain associated with the disease and decreased the number of times I had to use the bathroom from  40 per day to <20 per day. With continued use, I believe it helped reduce inflammation/mast cell production in my bladder, and along with dietary changes and treatment for infections to my bladder wall lining caused by Lyme disease related organisms, Elmiron allowed my bladder to heal to some degree, reducing my symptoms further and my incidence of urinating to <10 times per day on average.",high

However, after my surgery they kept me on 40 mg and I began having dizziness and severe general malaise in the mornings after taking it. (See treatment details.) When I began having the side effects after surgery, the doctor took me off of the Furosemide and the side effect immediately disappeared, and I also had no edema for a few weeks.

My specialist increased my dose to 600mg 3x a day. I have been on the dose for 5 yrs and have had little to no neck and shoulder spasms.  I wish i had know about this treatment yrs ago.

Dryness and flakiness were the two most common side effects that I experienced. In addition, my skin became more sensitive to environmental stresses like wind, cold, and sun.  Consequently my face often appeared flush. I used a non-soap cleanser to wash my face twice daily.  In the morning, I followed this with an application of Persa Gel and then a sunscreen.

chantix,4,"chantix smoking cessation - Chantix was incredibly effective for the purpose of smoking cessation. While users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking, I felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively, making smoking absolutely repellent, that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort. Vivid dreams, often lasting throughout the night, not necessarily disturbing, as some have reported, but (seemingly) long, deep, and realistic. Perhaps for this reason, I did not awake feeling well-rested while taking the drug. Significant loss of appetite occurred, but sugary foods seemed more appealing. Mood became depressed to the point that suicidal thoughts occurred. Began taking a low-dose as part of the ""starter pack."" Desire to smoke diminished quickly and was gone within only a few days.

There were no side effects -- but the expected effects were very intense -- a hot flush that moved from my face to my legs, and itching on my arms, legs, back, and torso. Niacin taken in such a large dose opens the capillaries. This increases the blood flow close to the skin and releases histamines. The resulting hot flush and itching lasts for about 15 minutes.  It is an interesting experience, but three times a day is a bit much, especially during my at work dose. The red face was alarming my customers and the itching was a bit too distracting.",Low

Seemed to make me feel very thirsty and somewhat faint feeling.  Did not feel well at all.  My coughing and infection dramatically subsided, however, the side effects made me feel so badly I quit taking it. This was prescribed to me for possible whooping cough...due to exposure to Pertusis through my daughter.  Even though my older daughter had received the Pertusis vaccine she still was finally diagnosed as having whooping cough.  It took several doctors to finally catch what she had.  In the meantime she was very sick...had several z-packs and failed to respond.

chantix,7,"chantix smoking cessation - This drug blocked the receptors for nicotine, so the cravings were extremely diminished. The dosage was increased over a week, so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly. The worst side effect was nausea.  When I reached the twice daily dose, I was nauseated most of the day. It was much better when I cut the pills in half and took them several times a day with plenty of liquid and food.  The other side effect is constipation. A low dose of a laxitive is helpful with this. I have quit smoking many times.  This time with Chantix has been the smoothest. 
The physical withdrawal was easier than times in the past.  I was somewhat irritable for a few days, but nothing severe.  The nausea and constipation were annoying, but I was able to work around them. The mental obsession of this addiction is still present at times, but no pill is going to make that go away. It has gotten easier with time.",high

I also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  Cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  I still have pain,sometimes better,sometimes worse, but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously. The gabapentin, which I was taking long before cymbalta, made me sleepy, but on the day after a night of disrupted sleep, the fatique can be overwhelming.  Also, for the first six months or so, I had a lot of gas and stomach rumblings.  When I first started on cymbalta, I felt very spacey and light-headed but that passed after a couple of weeks.

I plan to visit the doctor in eight weeks again at which time I am sure the doctor will check my blood for any changes that may have occurred.  But so far, nothing has been noticed. I have been on blood pressure medication for about seven years now.  Each doctor that I went to has changed my medication several times.

Impulsivity was greatly reduced, resulting in a calmer more productive day. Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home. There wer few side effects.  I experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking, speaking at meetings and in social situations.  This can be resolved with small candies, however, that resulted in tooth decay.  I am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist, however, I am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth. I am not sure what you want in this section.  I received counseling.  Medication was suggested.  Other more typical, stimulant  medications were tried but produced anxiety.  This is a newer non-stimulant medication, and that is a plus. I have continued counseling and periodic check-ups with the prescribing physician.  I am pleased with the results and plan on continuing with this treatment.",high
lexapro,10,"lexapro major depression - Lexapro has proven to be a very effective antidepressant that is entirely lacking in sexual side-effects. Lexapro is quite stimulating, which I consider to be a good thing, but I do consider the feeling of being a little too euphoric a side effect of the drug. I have suffered from dysthymia (low mood) with major depressive episodes for most of my adult life.  The newer antidepressants, particularly Prozac and Effexor, were lifesavers for me and I expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  Antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro, however, greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).  These medications also ""pooped out"" (stopped working) after a while, and even when they were working, they would not entirely relieve my low mood.  Ever since my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro several years ago, my mood issues have entirely disappeared with absolutely no adverse sexual side effects.",high

I tried Tylenol PM but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking Tylenol frequently so I discontinued use. I finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest, and after a consultation, i was prescribed Ambien. After trying it, I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares. I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later every night though, and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. After a month of that, I gave it up. I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better. Nightmares, short sleep time I was to take 1 nightly for 1 month to see if this helped my problem, then return to doctor for consultation.",Low
glucophage,7,"glucophage diabetes - Once daily dose was more convenient than split doses of previous medication. The gradual release of the medication certainly reduced stomach and bowel problems (frequency and urgency of bowel movements) that had hampered activities beneficial to health such as hiking. The medication produced moderate control of my diabetes, though it is hard to judge what my blood sugar would have been without it There is still some degree of bowel disturbance. however, the most concerning side effect (which is common to other (non time release) forms of metformin is impaired B12 and iron absorption. It took some time to identify this problem and I discovered it myself rather than being tested for it. Metformin was the treatment of choice for my diabetes as it does not produce weight gain. I take 4 time-release tablets after my evening meal. It is important to take the tablets with food to minimise digestive upsets.

oxazepam,1,"oxazepam temporary anxiety - My father was put on this drug to fend off temporary, situational anxiety when his wife developed alzheimer's and was not looking after the finances properly.  It helped him to sleep better.  In the meantime, our family helped them sort out the financial mess his wife had created in her confusion.  

His anxiety ended but the doctor forgot to take him off the drug at the end of the 4 month period of effectiveness. After 5 years of taking this drug, my father has developed short term memory loss which has developed to the point he now has an alzheimer's diagnosis for himself.  He has no other symptoms of AD, just short term memory loss after 5 years on a drug that is only proven 'effective' for 4 months. Due to a recent mix up at the pharmacy, my father was accidentally withdrawn from the drug and suffered a terrible withdrawal.  After 10 days without oxazepam, his memory improved but the doctor put him right back on it.  I have since tried to get the doc to take him off.  His answer?  What's the point at his age.  Why not just let him drift away in a foggy twilight.

oxycodone,3,"oxycodone pain management - Initially the treatment benefits were
-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain) The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few. I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. I'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION!",Low

mirapex,9,"mirapex restless leg syndrome - Before I began taking the Mirapex, I was taking Clonapin which was very ineffective as I was constantly waking up in the middle of the night having to take more medication to get back to sleep. I had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and I was exhausted all the time. On Mirapex,  I am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband. I have what I call a window of opportunity to take Mirapex by 7PM or I will be very ""anxious"" and highly uncomfortable due to the restless legs jumping and distress. It causes me to go to sleep shortly after taking it, which makes going to a movie theater almost impossible in the evening as I will sleep through most of the movie if I've taken my medicine. I take Mirapex at 7PM every night so that I will not feel the effects of the Restless Legs Syndrome and will fall asleep, sleeping through the night in my bed without having to get up and walk around. This is a big relief to me and enables me to sleep in the same bed as my husband whereas before, I had to get up out of bed and walk briskly around the house. Now I am rested and able to function the next day.

While using the Premarin pills for Hormonal Replacement Therapy I was also taking Progestin so am unsure as to which drug was causing my very painfully tender breasts with increased fibrocystic breast disease noted on my annual momograms. I suspect that these drugs were also contributing to the blood sugar issues and low throid. I chose to discontinue the HRT completely after I developed a painful mastitis in my lt breast, and 6months later a mamogram showed a suspicious spot that was removed and biopsied. It was benign.

premarin,1,"premarin hot flashes / night sweats - The Premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  From that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  However, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin. I developed strange lesions on my arms, which were sore and very embarrassing.  I could not wear short-sleeved shirts, because of the mess my arms had become.  Obviously, I showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.

When I added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet, the lesions disappeared completely.  I am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever. The doctor put me on the maximum dosage because I was ""young"" for menopause.

valium,10,"valium anxiety, panic disorder - I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed. I didn't have any side effects at all.  But it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (YES, I can actually feel when it starts) I started having panic attacks in different places until my world became very restricted.  A doctor prescribed Valium and it helped.  I have still got worse over the years but valium still helps me cope with things like that I wouldn't normally be able to do at all, like shopping, going to the dentist, or out in public.  I feel valium has had a very bad write up...mainly I feel through abuse.  I've taken it most of my life and never took more than I was told to.  In fact I was so afraid it would ""stop"" working that I only took it when absolutely necessary.  This means that although I have taken it most of my life in larger or smaller doses, it still works for me and gets me though the hard times.  I don't think I have ever tried a drug that has helped me cope as well as this one has.  I hope it never gets taken off the market.

I had failed all the standard treatments, including high oral doses of prednisone.  I was facing a life on a ventilator with a tube in my throat.  Within a few days of starting this medication, I could breath. Actually breath.  You who have had severe asthma know how wonderful air can be. Within a week, I went for a walk.

I had a hard time, going straight to sleep at night.  I generally stayed awake about 2 hours later than I normally did.  But in the morning I wasn't overly tired, and as soon as I took the next pill within 30 minutes I had no desire to go back to sleep.  Also sometimes I would have a funny taste in my mouth.

paxil,7,"paxil depression, social anxiety disorder - For the first two weeks I did not feel absolutely anything. Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects. Decreased libido, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite I was not able to have sex because Paxil left me sexually numb. It was difficult to maintain an erection. When I did get an erection it was without any sexual pleasure, in other words, it was just a mechanical erection.
I could not sleep no matter how tired I became during the day. I had constant energy that would not go away even when I wanted to sleep. The insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract Paxil.
Dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.
I gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short time. I went from 171lbs. to 227lbs. in about 4 months. Paxil gave me a huge appetite. I simply could not stop thinking about food, particularly sweets.",high

synthroid,9,"synthroid hypothyroidism - Having been diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was only twenty, I was administered varying levels of Synthroid.  Prior to taking the medication, my hypothyroid condition was so severe that my metabolism was adversely affected.  Not only did I feel sluggish, but my liver was even slow to act because I started turning orange! My fingertips were calloused, my speech was slurred and my hair had begun falling out.  When the first dosage was given, it was too high.  Then when it was adjusted and my blood levels determined that it was the right amount, the symptoms all began to subside and slowly I became functional again.  I don't normally take any over-the-counter medications but as for this prescription medication, I need it to effectively manage my hypothyroidism. Initially, when the dosage given to me was too high, I became a little jittery.  If the doctor prescribes the right dosage for you, there should be minimal to no side effects at all. Synthroid (generic name: Levoxyl) is taken once a day, preferably in the morning on an empty stomach.  There do not seem to be any extra details concerned with the daily administration of the drug.",high

Topamax has reduced twice weekly migraine headaches to approx. 3 or 4 times a year for severe migraines, although I still suffer from chronic, but infinitely much easier to bear, daily headache. I am thankful for the use of this (originally) anti-seizure drug for migraine prevention. Mild loss of appetite. Loss of interest in alcoholic beverages. For the past six years of treatment, via a neurologist, I have been adjusting the medication from 400mg to 600 mg per day, to the current dosage of 400mg per day, in a divided dose. One tablet am, one tablet pm. I would recommend Topamax to anyone suffering with chronic migraine as the primary drug treatment, with additional rx with triptan meds.",high

relpax,8,"relpax migraine headaches - The medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it. The side effects were mild compared to the pain. Around 30 minutes after taking the pill, I would feel a little tired and sleepy.  However the feeling would not be so severe that I could not work or continue daily tasks.  This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours. At the onset of the headache, I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night, around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.  It is extremely important to take this pill at the onset of a headache.",high
nortriptyline,7,"nortriptyline shooting nerve-type pain in legs/fibromyalgia - the excruciating, shooting nerve pain in my left leg stopped after about a week although I could still feel that the nortriptyline just masked the pain ie. In the past 6 months I have got down to 12.5 mg per day although a recurrence of the terrible shooting pain (after 2 years) had made me decide to try Gabapentin instead- my doc recommends this Fuzziness of thinking/short term memory loss- although this might be due to my fibromyalgia. Sexual disfunction- ie inability to have a full orgasm- and after 2 years of this, thi sis one of the reasons why I am ready to change to Gabapentin- as recommended by my doc. Sleepiness etc goes away after the first few weeks although it took me a good 6 months to properly adapt to this drug 10mg at night for the first 6 months, then the pain came through again so I upped this to 25mg per day. Six months ago, I wasn;t aware of any pain behind the pain that I had been used to so, thinking I was maybe a bit better, I cut the intake down to 12.5 mg a day by cutting my 25mg tablet in half each night. this was fine until a week ago when the shocking shooting pain returned accompanied by pin-prick sensations on my face and on my limbs- I've not had thi sin 2 years. I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg, is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows, sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain. But who knows, maybe I will be able to be pain-free and get my libido back...!",high
accutane,10,"accutane acne - Completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face, neck, shoulders, back, and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time. Dry, chapped lips and dry, flaky skin especially after showers. Both were completely treatable with chapstick and good lotion. No serious side effects, and no alarming changes in liver function or triglycerides on blood tests. No depression as well. I had slight to moderate acne that was just really annoying and was not fixed by any type of treatment, so I finally gave in and went on Accutane. After reading all the online horror stories I was scared out of my mind. However, I had a great experience on it. I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.",high

lexapro,10,"lexapro general depression/perimenopause - Started taking this drug for two reasons - peri-menopausal symptoms (mood swings) and depression experienced after going through hurricane Katrina. After 2-3 weeks of starting, noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated. Fortunately, none for me. I know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain, but I have had no issues here. The only thing I noticed was the very first week I took it I was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day, but this went away once I adjusted. Started out with a very low dose, 5mg/day for the first month, then moved up to 10 mg/day which is my present dose. The full dose is actually 20mg/day, but I feel I am getting the results I need with 10mg, so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects.",high
mercaptopurine,8,"mercaptopurine crohn's disease - I was prescribed the drug Mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep. Though the Crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and I feel that the addition of the Mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  The fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  I also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  By suppressing my immune system I believe the Mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop. I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease about eight years ago.  The doctor started with a series of Remicade and a prescription of Prednisone. This combination made it possible for me to eat again - hurray!  As for maintenance drugs, I have been on several, including Asacol and Pentasa.  There were probably others, but those are the two that I definitely remember.  It seemed as though my body would react well to a drug, but then the drug eventually lost that initial effectiveness. I have been on Mercaptopurine for 3-4 years now, and am getting ready to ask to move to a new drug. Mercaptopurine seems to be continuing to do a good job as a drug, but I'd like to find one that may be less deleterious to my liver.",high

I just wanted people to know that once you adjust to this medicine it was a big help for my child's leg pain. I hope this is enough words.

I took seasonique for nine months and had 20 days of breakthrough bleeding every three months.  It didn't matter if I took the pill everyday at the same time or took one later or even skipped one, it was always 20 days of breakthrough bleeding (at the least, 20 days).

Before you realize it... you will have gone a whole day or maybe days/weeks without even thinking about a cigarette subconcsiously and when you do smoke a cigarette there is little to no euphoria or any other sensation for that matter, its just the taste of smoke and nicotine.

For no apparent reason the dosage needs to be adjusted, up or down from time to time. Fortunately hypertension is not asymptomatic in this patient: have a headache, it's up, raise the dose; feel wiped out, it's down, lower the dose.

There are reports of depression as side effects but since I suffer from depression anyway it's hard to tell. Haven had any worsening of depression since starting singulair. Singulair has been very beneficial in controlling my asthma and bronchitis. Do not notice it helps much with my allergies though.

My biggest issue is that it takes more than 2 0r 3 doses over the same amount of days to feel any relief, and as soon as you stop taking it - the burn is back. It's also pricy, even with insurance.",high
lexapro,8,"lexapro depression - This drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  The depression was less affected, but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time. At first the dose of 20mg left me a little zombie like.  I'd sit and stare out the window all day.  When the dose was reduced to 10mg. this side effect went away.  I also developed a clenched jaw, which sometimes I snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  I also developed ringing in my ears.  I also gained weight, a total of 25 pounds. I was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug, beginning with 20mg and then reducing it to 10mg.  I was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  This drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together I believe they were very effective.  I was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  The side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain.",high
zyrtec,8,zyrtec water in ear - It did clear up my inner ear water. It also seemed to dry up the constant mucus that seemed to be in my sinuses. This helped me to be able to breathe better. The only side effect that I could notice was dryness in my mouth and nostrils. I seemed to be thirsty all of the time. And my nose and sinuses seemed to be really dry. I took 1 pill each day. I enjoyed not having to take it more than once per day. I have problems remembering to take more than one dose a day.,high
mobic,3,"mobic bursitis - I did not notice any benefits in terms of decrease of pain or inflammation in the affected site.  I've found fish oil and curcumin to be far more effective with fewer side effects. Personally, I noticed an increase in constipation as a result of taking this medication.  I also saw an increased incidence of heart burn during that period. I was experiencing inflammation in my hip after surgery.  Mobic was prescribed to deal with the inflammation, but I didn't notice any strong positive effects.",Low
fluconazole,7,"fluconazole yeast infection - The single dose was easy to take, and the drug got rid of any other fungal infections in my body that may have contributed to the vaginal yeast infection. I had extreme intestinal bloating and very painful gas for a few hours the evening after I took the drug.  These subsided, but my gut still was a bit upset after eating for the next day, and I didn't have a bowel movement for 48 hours. One tablet taken orally one time to combat a vaginal yeast infection.",high
celebrex,7,"celebrex crohn's/colitis - The medication does seem to help with joint inflammation.  I find no real benefit for headaches or body aches.  There are some studies that show this drug may be beneficial for the treatment of polyps in the large intestine which may be a benefit for me in the long run. None that I am aware of though I am cautioned by my Doctors that the fact that I have been taking this drug for a long time even though my dosage is not the highest, that it may have an adverse effect on my heart. I take 2 100 mg pills a day.  As I said it does help with joint inflammation.  My attitude is, ""what is the alternative"".  Since I do not have an expiration date stamped on me, I will not know if this drug lengthened or shortened my life.  But it does help me today to lead what I think of as a more 'normal' life.",high
adderall,9,"adderall attention deficit disorder - My attention span was incrementally increased, as was the intensity of my focus. Also, while taking the drug, I noted a significant decrease in my appetite, which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss. I experienced heightened levels of sleeplessness while on the medication. In addition, I was constantly concerned about my ability to study and perform while not on the medication. While this is not a physical side effect, it is a very real emotional one that caused me some stress. After noticing that I was having difficulty being attentive during my high school classes, experiencing an inability to sustain focus on one thing at a time, and was unable to finish assignments on time due to these two symptoms, I decided to see my doctor. He asked me a variety of questions about my current state and the problems I was having, and after listening, prescribed a small dosage of Adderall to alleviate these issues. After taking the first dose, my concentration increased ten-fold. As a result, my grades went up. I discontinued my use of Adderall upon my college graduation, and have found that while I still suffer from symptoms of attention deficit disorder, it is having a decreased effect on my adult life.",high
lamisil,7,"lamisil fingernail fungus - My fingernails have grown back to where the nail hits the end of where it should be instead of clipped down. I cant wait for the nail to grow  back all the way to where I can pick up a piece of thin paper with my fingernail, as I work at an office!.Also, the little black splinters under my thumb nail are starting to go away, as is the yellowing and thickness of the nail, due to the infection. A long time ago, 10 years, when I was prescribed lamisil by my doctor, I had dark circles under my eyes and was tired lots of time. When I went back to teh doctor he told me he had to take me off the lamisil because it was harming my liver function. But by that time, the effect of teh medicine was enough for my nails to grow back after that. I think it was a change in climate, moving away from Astoria to a dryer climate of Portland. When I saw the doctor 10 or so years ago, My nails were so bad, it was hard to look at them. The nails were thin and undernieth there was the infection of pus, so much that I had to clip the nails down and even pull one off; which wasnt difficult, because it was so weak, it just came right off. But after I took the lamisil, they grew back better, eventually.",high

desyrel,1,"desyrel insomnia - There were few benefits.  It still took me a long time to go to sleep, about two hours.  Some nights it didn't work at all.  When dosage was increased the side effects became unacceptable.  I took the medication for a week and then could not stand it anymore.  It was preferable to go without sleep than to take this drug. Dizziness, dry mouth, extremely dry skin, highly increased urination, memory problems. I started with a half pill, then it was increased to 1 due to ineffectiveness.  It was increased to 1 1/2, then 2 pills.",Low
zoloft,1,zoloft depression - I had no benefits.  It didn't seem to make anything better at the time.  It seemed the depression was still the same and then I had side effects that affected me daily. I suffered from daily Headaches and also  slight nausea every once in awhile. I also felt very dried out and thirsty.  It also affected me by lowering my  libido. I was supposed to take a pill every morning with water.  I felt better once I stopped taking the pills and actually just started working on myself and my goals and then also wehn I started doing volunteer work to help children.,Low
retin-a-micro,7,"retin-a-micro acne - Less pimples, increased smoothness of skin peeling; difficulty applying makeup due to the peeling; difficulty keeping the makeup looking acceptable during the day due to peeling; dryness on occasion; sensitivity mainly in the neck region; greater sensitivity to products such as foundation and many sunsceens - particularly those containing Helioplex I applied the product at night along with a moisturizer recommended by my doctor.  While there was a decrease in blemishes, I still have several on any given day.  This is has not been a completely effective treatment on its own.",high
lortab,6,"lortab oral surgery - considerably reduced pain, if i experienced any at all. With two tablets, the main difference was moderate to severe drowsiness. With either dosage, I experienced vibrant dreams/nightmares and/or an elated/lightheaded feeling while awake. Constipation relieved with extra fiber. In my experience with this medication, I've found it moderately addicting and should be taken with caution. I advise to take when in mild-moderate pain because that's what it's for, but hold off taking it every six hours (or as prescribed) if pain is not an issue.",high
amoxil,7,"amoxil heart murmur/dental procedures - Since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure, the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. However, I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections. Sleeplessness, easily bruised, diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so AFTER I ceased taking Amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. It's my understanding that this high-dosage, antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended. To the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. I followed that procedure.",high
retin-a-micro,9,"retin-a-micro repair and prevent wrinkles - Retin A Micro has lessened any uneven skin pigmentation.  Retin A Micro has minimized the size of my pores.  Retin A Micro has minimized wrinkling in my skin. Retin A Micro causes me to peel the second day after I use Retin A Micro in the evening.  Retin A Micro initially causes more noticible fine lines when used around the eyes but I am continuing to use around the eyes for 6 months to see if ultimately it improves this area. I initially began using Retin A Micro all over my face and neck (avoiding eye area) every other night.  My skin is fair and a little sensitive and it has tolerated it very well.  Every other day I do get a slight peeling of my skin around my mouth, my chin and my nose.  This peeling can easily be removed by sloughing off the peeling skin.  The benefits of Retin A Micro are unlike any skin product you could buy over the counter, used in conjunction with an effective sunscreen.",high
prozac,7,"prozac depression - Prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years, along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac. The main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. Over time the shaking turned into tremors which I could not control. Then I was placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and finally weined off of Prozac and the tremors subsided. I took Prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. At first my depression was under control but after about 5 years the depression began to become more intense. I was then placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and my depression soon was improving. However, I started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. So after 2 years of Prozac and Wellbutrin I was told to stop Prozac. Within 6 months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only Wellbutrin (150 mg/day)",high
concerta,9,"concerta add - It allowed me to focus on what I was learning, ie, in class work that I may have stopped attending to otherwise, or would have bluted out something ""inappropriat"" without thinking it through before I spoke.
It also allowed me to continue to pay attention and focus on a subject that I have no interest in but must understand and learn, ie, math. The drug makes one sweat.It can work as an appetite suppressant if you don't eat before you take it and plan snacks throughout the day;allowing you to be appropriately hungry when it wears off. I think that you can use a drug like this as an adult and greatly benefit IF you retrain yourself behaviorally at the same time. The drug does not hold the key to your success, you do. It helps you if you work ""with it"" and relearn patterns and behaviors. examples are: time management and actually becoming AWARE of time for the first time in my life. I always wear a watch now and use alarms.I make lists,I plan short term and long term .
It allowed me to develop some control over myself and my life; life no longer just ""happens"" to me. I am present.",high

I was extremely tired, dizziness, slight headaches, and developed shortness of breath from time to time, aching extremities. 25mg once a day, then 12.5, and now 6.5 until im off.

relpax,8,relpax migraine - if taken within the first hour of of your personal migraine symtoms the med. works very well. usually within an hour you can control the nausea and light sensitivity with only a little sleepiness.it only takes about 30 to 60 minutes to take effect so if you catch it early you can forego almost all your pain. the main side effects for me are sleepiness and moodiness. the sleepiness can be good if you have time to rest for a couple of hours..if not... it can be a little difficult to navigate through the day. the moodiness for me may simply be my depression over having another migraine...i am always hoping my last migraine was my last. take one tablet on the onset of headache..usually if i take it within the first 30 min. i can control the nausea that accompanies the migraine...if i wait too long the med. doesn't work very well. also the ins. company limits me to 8 pills a month so if have to be very dilligent about taking the med. right away or i will have to take a second one a few hours later....they are too precious to use that much,high

As I only took it for 2 weeks, cannot be sure of effectiveness About 2 days after starting the course I began to get muscle pains. I had had these pains before (months ago) but the drug seemed to amplify them.

I can't remember the stupidest things or I don't like to go out with my friends anymore cause I don't like to drink alchol anymore.

lipitor,10,"lipitor high cholesterol - Overall cholesterol dropped from 270 to 180. HDL went up, LDL went down to optimal ratios. My cholesterol numbers changed very quickly, within little over a month. Obviously, it's a very effective drug for me. No detectable side effects. I hope that there are no long-term liver problems due to this drug, and at this time, there are no indications of any problems in this area. One 10 mg pill, 1x per day. 

I also received a blood test for liver abnormality at one month, three months, and one year, after beginning treatment. I now receive a blood test for liver abnormalities every 1 1/2 to 2 years, along with the rest of my regular bloodwork at normal checkups. So far, there have been no indications of any problems.

I'm also taking 200 mg per day of co q10 to replace what the Liptor diminishes. I do wish that my physician had mentioned this to me when he prescribed the Lipitor, but I actually found out about co q10 and lipitor through reading Dr Oz and Rizen's book ""You, Staying Young"". Upon asking my doctor about the co q10, he was familiar with it in relation to Lipitor usage, but never brought it up on his own. I realize that I would have continued taking Lipitor without any co q10 addition if I hadn't stumbled upon those facts by accident myself, and wish that when a physician prescribes a medication that they would also suggest any other supplements that should be taken or avoided along with the prescription.

Overall, this drug has been very successful for me. As I understand it, most people have to take a much higher dose than i do to obtain similar benefits, so I'm fortunate in this area, as I don't like to take much medication.",high
ortho-novum,7,"ortho-novum birth control - The only treatmenet benefits were the prevention of pregnancy and the near elimination of a monthly menstrual cycle --including the elimination of painful cramping during the monthly cyle.  The benefits at the time I was taking this medication outweighed the risks/side effects, but now the risks/side effects outweigh the benefits. The main side effect was moodiness/mood swings.  I did not notice this so much while taking the medication.  I noticed the moodiness/mood swings more after being off of the medication for an extended period of time.  After being off of the medication I noticed a more stabe, hightened mood. The treatment continued off and on for approximately 10 years.  During this time, I did go off of the medication for short intervals just due to the lack of necessity for the drug.  The medication was taken on a daily basis, and was effective.  Now, however, for me--the health risks involved in taking the drug (risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots) far outweigh the benefits (I am a non smoker).  In addition, the mood factor also played a part in not returning to taking this drug.",high

fioricet,8,"fioricet chronic tension headache - Very good pain relief and muscle relaxation.  Great for alleviating pain from an especially bad headache but also works good as an adjunct for musculoskeletal pain. Sedation, dizziness, very mild euphoria, intoxicated feeling (slurred speech, ataxia) at higher or repeated doses.  Addiction risk. Good at knocking down a particularly bad headache or other breakthrough pain.  Works better when taken at first sign of pain.  Butalbital and caffeine can cancel each other's sedating and stimulating effects, but a tolerance to caffeine will negate that.  Even so caffeine helps boost the effectiveness of acetaminophen.
Tolerance to butalbital's intoxication effects happen quickly but it can still be sedating.  Driving and other functions are impaired; if I have to take fioricet it's typically in the evening and then I'm done for the day.",high

nuvaring,9,"nuvaring birth control - Ability to have benefits of birth control in the convenience of a ring, that allows freedom from worrying about taking a pill and an unwanted pregnancy. My first week with the ring I experienced extreme nausea, upset stomach and a tremendous decrease in appetite.  These symptoms slowly faded as the weeks passed.  Now the only side effects I notice are a less than normal appetite and occasional vaginal irritation, but nothing to painful or bothersome that I feel the need to seek medical treatment. I'm married, I have both a full & part time job and I'm enrolled 15 hrs in school.  The ONE LESS STRESS of NOT having to worry about birth control let's me focus on what's important right now.  This is my method of choice and will be until I decide I'm ready for children.  Nuvaring is reliable... you can't really mess it up.  The fact that I don't have to worry about a little pill everyday makes my quality of life better.  I have the Nuvaring timer, which you can order from the website, that aids in reminding me that it's time, whether it be insertion or removal, and can be reset for whatever day you choose for insertion.  I can see how one might forget they even have it in them.  I do not feel it, my husband cannot feel it, and it has not fallen out, like several other women have claimed.  I'm very pleased with this and hope that it works as well for others as it has for me.",high

I took one 10mg tablet every night and it was very effective for the first week or so. Then after the first week I found that one tablet wasn't very effective, I had trouble falling asleep and also woke up several times during the night. I took 2 tablets for the next few days and it worked well, but after that it wasn't working well anymore so I took 4 tablets one night.

When I tried to lower (self medicate) the dosage, my racing and repeating thoughts came back really strong.  I started counting again, repeating sentences in my head, singing song verses over and over in my head, replaying conversations over in my head, etc.  Being back on the 20mg keeps me feeling normal and only in very stressful situations do I start obsessing/repeating. I didn't experience any side effects.  I purposely did not read what the potential side effects might be, as I tend to ""develop"" whatever I read about. The initial treatment involved the medication and weekly therapy sessions.  A year into the treatment, I was able to scale the therapy back to ""as needed"" appointments, a year later I went off of the Wellbutrin and now feel pretty healthy just on the Lexapro.",high

Also some irritability which we cannot be sure but may be related to the drug.  However, it could be due to the nighttime seizures which are still occurring. Take 500 mg of Valproic Acid before bed, daily, and 375 mg at breakfast, daily.  This dose was titrated up slowly and eventually stopped at this level.

I do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid. After about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping, bloating, and diareaha.  My body is now completely depended on the drug and my understanding is that the pill is telling my body not to produce acid which in turn works harder to produce more, which makes since when i have tried to go off of it my acid reflux was 20 times worse.  My body has become completely dependent on the drug. The treatment details were that i did not need to change my diet, but to just take one pill every day and that would take care of my issue with my body producing to much acid.",Low

innofem,7,"innofem hot flashes, unable to sleep - I did get relief from the hot flashes and this did contribute to a good nights sleep. I had a hystirectomy a year before I was put on the hormones. I say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. I can not say that I have seen a slowing in the aging process but I am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin. I have not experienced any side effects to my knowledge. I feel as if an increase in the dose would maybe last longer as I seem to be waking at least once a night with a hot flash. I take it in the morning so maybe by the time I hit the sheets it is out of my system. I do not miss a day and always take it at the same time each morning. As I stated I had a hystirectomy at 50 years old. I went over a year w/out any homone treatment and the hot flashes got so severe I was waking about 5 to 6 times a night. I was using over the counter sleep aids and did not like them. I got the doctor to prescribe the hormones and the benefits were almost immediate.

It also dries up blemishes peeling, dryness, slight irritation. There weren't any serious side effects.  the packaging warns about sun exposure but I stay away from the sun so I did not have a reaction from the sun while using product. I used this cream a few times a week at first and now I use it only occasionally. It is a moderately thick white cream that I applied only to target areas, frown lines, forehead, etc. Also applied to breakouts.

I had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking Wellbutrin, my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  I was not a majorly depressed person, just mildly depressed and fatigued, and also becoming uninterested in activities that I used to enjoy.

(The pain goes from the left side of my forehead, down my face, my neck, my shoulder, and my left arm).  I sometimes wonder if I really need it, so occasionally I stop taking it, but within 3 to 4 days, the pain comes back full force, so I know it is effective.  It is slightly less effective than Vioxx.

Had 6weeks of a cough which i though was a developing chest infection that i was fighting off as never turned into anything and i felt fine.

At some point, I realized the generic was available and switched to it.  I did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as I thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand, minus the ink used to print ""Wellbutrin"" on the pills.  It took about a month before I thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of ""heart pounding.""  I switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  Also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase, I think, but I didn't actually take my pulse), I had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  This was not a surface capillary, but a deep vessel, that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.

clobex,9,"clobex contact dermatitis - Clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection. Have since had no need for Clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. For those who chose to traditional medications, I can recommend Clobex for mild to severe dermatitis. I was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of Skin MRSA, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes. none Had developed contact dermatitis on my arm; cause unknown. dermatologist prescibed Clobex .05% BID until condition cleared.

I believe the benefits were to keep my skin soft, prevent sagging and wrinkles I was prescribed estrogen at the time of my total hysterectomy (due to increasing bleeding and starting periods every 2 weeks). I was becoming anemic from the bleeding and other procedures to stop this were not very successful. I was about 45 at the time and was given the option to begin HRT. Over the years I have been given decreasing levels and am currently at .5mg. Even with the negative info regarding prolonged HRT, I opted to continue.  If you actually read the negative information, it was not related to estrogen, but rather to estrogen and progesterone in combination.  Since then more articles have further clarified some of the mis-information.  It may be a risk to continue long term HRT, but none of my doctors has really presented any solid reasoning to discontinue HRT.",high

I started on the medication when I was 19 and am still on it today at age 50.  I've tried other new drugs but always seem to come back to this tried and true one. The only complaint I have is that Corgard tends to lower your blood sugar if you are prone to that anyway.  If I increased my dosages to over 20mg daily, I would have many problems with low blood sugar, even to the point of passing out.  I learned how to deal with it, but wish it was not a side effect.

I am 43 now but took Accutane back in my early 20's for moderate cyctic acne.  I took a second course in my 30's for mild/moderate non-cystic acne which was probably hormone related.  I absolutely loved taking Accutane and wished that I could take it again at a milder dosage to treat blackheads and have that smooth ""poreless"" skin again.  It seems to speed up skin cell sloughing and I didn't need to exfoliate, just use a good cream.  After years of taking antibiotics and using awful creams that made my skin dry and red, Accutane was a godsend.

Each zap lasted about 0.5 seconds, and seemed to be triggered by ""mild sensory overloads"", e.g., entering a room with different lighting conditions. The zaps were not painful at all, just confusing and (initially) frightening. Upon resuming the drug, the zaps disappeared as quickly as they had appeared (~20 h). Treatment was initiated by a general practictioner for self-reported tiredness and panic attacks. The next appointment was in two weeks. Since there were no continuing side effects, and the drug seemed effective, we decided to continue it for at least 6 months. I have now been taking it for 3 months.",high

I had to watch my diet for foods that would affect the clotting time of the drug.  I.E. a margarita would thin my blood but guacamole would make it thicker.
Also I had to be careful not to cut myself while shaving since my blood was thinner that normal and would bleed a long time. I have had two episodes of thrombophlebitis with deep vein thrombosis diagnosed the first time with a veinogram, and the second time with an ultrasound.  I was hospitalized 11 days each time and put on heparin through an IV with complete bedrest.

I had no appetite which caused me to lose 10 pounds in a month. Also not having an appetite made me not eat enough, so I would get more headaches because I wasn't eating enough. I also felt very depressed on this medication. During the time I was on topamax I slept a lot and didn't eat enough, I didn't feel like I was myself.

If I was upset about something, I wasn't experiencing the sever mood swings I normally would. My frustration and anger no longer controlled me. A general sense of being able to handle my negative emotions without falling apart. My family noticed a big difference. in the beginning I had symptoms of vertigo which occured when turning my head or standing quickly. The dizziness felt worse each time the medication dose was increased and eventually stopped or was significantly less pronounced. The feelings lasted about 2-6 weeks. Some weight gain. I was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for over a year and had tried 4-5 medications for depression, some worked temporarily, some not at all. Both therapists thought my symptoms indicated Bipolar II and I should try a different approach. I stared on a very low dose, as indicated, so the benefits took a while to notice.

mirapex,9,"mirapex restless leg syndrome - The benefits were remarkable and fast.  Before taking the mirapex, the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  After taking the mirapex, the restless legs calmed down immediately.  The patient can now go to a movie, take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  The restless legs are not totally cured, but it is manageable now.  Even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable. The only side effect that the patient experienced was drowsiness and that has weakened as time has gone by.  With only taking one pill at noon, the drowsiness is not marked and does not interfere with work or anything else.  The patient takes 2 pills around 8 or 9:00 at night so the drowsiness is not a problem. The patient developed restless leg syndrome around the age of 35 after a boating accident where her back was injured.  The doctors do not know if the back injury brought on the restless legs or not.  The patient went to many doctors and neurologists.  The doctors tried many medicines but with no success.  Finally the patient found a neurologist in central Kansas that figured out immediately what was wrong.  The doctor put the patient on mirapex on a trial basis after performing many tests to rule out other causes or problems.  The patient has never been on another medicine for restless legs since going on the mirapex.  The  patient does take a multivitamin with iron in it to help with the restless legs and the patient also does not have caffeine drinks.",high

Only side effect was in the first couple of days, I would feel light headed at times.  I have dreams I remember now verses not remembering them before the drug.  Any other side effect could be contributed to the other medicines I have to take so I can't say if the mood swings or sleeping habits are due to the Chantix.  Major side effect is the cost.  This drug costs two and half times as much as my smoking habit per month. I did the starter packet for the first seven days as prescriped.  Now I am on the 1mg twice a day.",high

Nightmares and sleep walking and talking ? if these are side effect of that drug but there was a definate increase in both (esp sleep talking) when i was on the drug. Increased appitite (the weight didnt come from nowhere) was warned about pos weight gain but was told that if you controlled your eating youd be fine but my hunger was crazy i would eat a main meal and 1/2 hour later be starving like i hadnt eaten all day. I found it really hard to control my intake due to my excessive hunger. I also had heavy spotting the whole time i was on it and for about 5 months after i stopped the injections. I guess it was a very effective birth control as i had become depressed, overweight, had my period the whole time and was more interested in food than sex. Over all was not worth taking it, i actually regret taking it, was devestating for a 18year old at the time to go through.  I also found it very hard to loose the weight during or afterwards, continued to gain weight for 6months after the last injection before any changes occured despite exercise and diet changes.

doxycycline,3,"doxycycline acne - There was an improvement in the healing time for acne Severe acid stomach and cramping, to the point where I could no longer take the medicine.  I stopped taking Doxycycline for a year and tried topical clindamycin and other potential treatments but none worked.  Therefore, I started on Doxycycline treatment again after a year as it had led to some improvement in my acne.  Within 3 days, I again had severe stomach acidity and cramping and had to stop taking it. 50mg Doxycycline taken one at night with food, meant to be 2 - 3 month treatment for acne.  Unable to continue with treatment.

By the way, the most effective treatment I have now found for treating current acne is Freederm, a nicotinamide based product which is the only topical treatment I have found that improves my acne.  It does not prevent new acne outbreaks.

betaseron,8,"betaseron multiple sclerosis - Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for. I do, for some unknown reason, still have side effects from the betaseron.  They don't happen every injection, and there is no pattern.  I will have a fever and/or chills, and I hurt all over.  It feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   And my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles, but they are NOT infections, just a side effect.  And for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst. I guess the treatment details are how I take it.  The injections are deep subcutaneous.  Because the drug is very hard on tissue, you can't inject into the same area.  Upper arms are divided into 6 imaginary sections, abdomen 6 areas, legs 6 areas, and buttocks 6.  So inject into first arm area on one arm, then next injection opposite arm, then abdomen, legs, and buttocks.  Then you must start over in the first arm, but a different section and then work your way down again.  This keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.  The injections are every other night, and come in a pre-measured syringe the must be mixed SLOWLY with the powder immediately before injection.  MAKE SURE to NOT agitate the sol'n, as it will foam, then you can't get it in the syringe, and then it's useless.",high

meridia,10,"meridia obesity - BMI was 36 before I started Meridia.  After 4 monhts, BMI is 28.  Lost 43 pounds.  Increased energy and confidence.  Another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  I had low blood pressure and was quite passive before, and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before. Increased heart rate.  After day 9 on Meridia, felt hungry when my body was hungry - constant hunger stopped. After day 9 on the medication, I no longer had that feeling of starving all the time. When I started Meridia, I also started the Jenny Craig program to educate myself on nutrition and get support.  My knowledge of nutrition was so limited that a nutritionist would not have been able to teach me such basic principles - I needed to be taught like a child.

Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.  Their general energy levevls were low for about 2 months.

citalopram,1,"citalopram suicidal feelings - None. When I was last encountering depression 10 years ago, my Doctor gave me some round green pills whose name I can't rememeber. They worked well, helping numb my depression as I sorted out my life. After recent suicidal feelings regarding a reactive depression to losing my job, my GP prescribed me Citalopram. I just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy. I took one late at night hoping to feel sleepy at least, but had one of the worst nights sleep of my life. I encountered sweating,shakes, jaw grinding, and horrible hallucinatory dreams whilst still awake.  My GP told me I had to take them for at least a fortnight to feel any effect so tried again the following night, but the side effects were even worse. The way my jaw and teeth would involuntairily chatter was scary as hell. If I did this every sleepless night for 2 weeks, I'd have ended up insane, so I stopped after after just 2 nights I never went back to the doctor. I was so desperate for a good nights sleep without teeth-grinding and nightmares, I fell back on alcohol. I've never taken Valium, but feel I should've been given something similar - somthing that would heavily sedate me while I was feeling suicidal. Luckily after a week, my fortunes changed, and I found work again, so the suicidal feelings went.  But I would never take Citalopram again.",Low

lamictal,7,"lamictal depression and anxiety - Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). The mood difference is noticeable. My pscychiatrist prescribed Lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, Lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice. I have noticed no side effects.

lexapro,7,"lexapro depression - happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured groggy sometimes. And I could not really stop, though I was able to play with the amount of the trazodone, lowering it down to 50 mg. whenever ever I could. I did not notice side effects from Lexapro, just perhaps that I became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. So at a certain point, I wanted to get off. I had wonderful dreams on trazodone, but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for 1-3 extra hours. 50-150 mg of trazodone and 20 mg of lexapro daily. I took all at night, just before going to bed. I would when trying to bring the Trazodone down--so I would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly, 25 mg less every few days. Usually this would work. If I woke in the middle of the night, I would immediately get up and take another 50 mg. I have probably taken up to 250 mg in one night, but very rarely. And I have had long periods where I was at 50 mg, only taking more if I was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. I recommend this combination really.",high

After four years of using Stratterra, I would never switch to a different ADHD medication. Stratterra surpresses my appetite and makes me feel quite dependent on the drug to function. If I take with my multivitamin, I often feel nauseous. I take 1 60 mg of Stratterra in the morning daily.",high
coumadin,1,"coumadin leg blood clot, dvt - The leg clot would not extend nor would other clots form, potentially causing death. These were severe and included extreme and continuous nausea, feeling generally shitty (technical term employed by patient), no libido and inability to maintain erection during sex, orgasms that petered out and gave little pleasure, no overall energy for life.
Patient decided to stop medication and try natural/alternative substance to thin the blood.  this resulted in an extension of the clot and increased severity of pain, leading to emergency room visit and subsequent use of different blood thinner, syntron. Treatment included 2months of heparin injections in abdomen.  Coumadin was given daily after the injections were stopped, at 6mg. The discontinuation of this medication caused an extension of the clot and re-admittance to hospital and another drug for blood thinning was given.   Eventually, 6 months later, a doctor prescribed a compression stocking, which helped dramatically with swelling and pain.  The Syntron blood thinner had no noticeable side-effects.  Except possibly a still reduced libido.",Low
imitrex,10,"imitrex migraines - Improved my quality of life and was able to maintain a job for longer period of time. I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to! Usually a feel of tiredness 10 to 12 hours after initial dose which can last up to 24 hours. Taking one dose of the pill has less effects of tiredness then taking the 6mg shot or taking them both within a 24hr period. After over the counter medications failed to relieve headache pain I could tell if the headache was triggering a migraine and at that time take the imitrex pill and the migraine would be totally gone within 30 minutes. If the migraine was to strong with nausea symptoms and the pill didn't work, I would then take a imitrex 6mg shot for almost instant relief including nausea. Very rarely will the imitrex not work and then I have to go to emergency room.",high

prozac,9,"prozac depression/stress - Having suffered with depression/anxiety after the break up of my marriage, during which I lost a huge amount of weight, couldn't sleep, was agitated, tearful etc etc. the fluoxetine initially helped me relax and gave me a 'holiday from myself'.  The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  I regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine, have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings. No side effects as such.  However, the negative from my point of view is that there is an almost unreal calmness and lack of feeling/excitement/or even anger.........however as it is my intention to only use the fluoxetine for what is a relatively short term period, I beleive that this has been a 'symptom' worth experiencing. 20 mg once a day.",high

On days that I forgot to take a capsule, I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet. There were no side effects that I could trace directly to Meridia. Mild constipation is a possible side effect, but that could also have been due to dehydration. I took one Meridia first thing in the morning and then stuck to a sensible diet for the day.  If I took the Meridia too late in the day, it did keep me from sleeping well that night.",high

Therefor, depression was a thing of the past when I take this medication. It help my mind to focus and stay sharp.  I can concentrate better with this medication. Taking prozac made me more sleepy and I could not get up to do everyday thing. I just kept sleeping or yawning.  I wanted my depresion to go away but it did the opposite. Instead of helping me keep me depresed I felted more depresed because I kept sleeping all the time. The medication Prozac with me did not help my depression but rather calm me to the extent that I did not want to do anything. Also I kept going to the bathroom constantly. It takes down my sexual mood and difficulty in getting aroused at all.  Ritalin cause my mouth to dry up and kept drinking water like a camel. Jittery effect and when the medication wear off you feel it like large thump. Doctor suggested to take Prozac at night time and Ritalin twice a day. So far it has worked for me a patient suffering depression for more than 15 years and it has helped me the Ritalin.

cipro,1,"cipro throat infection - I had taken this medication, Cipro, as prescribed by my general practicioner to treat a strep throat infection.  The first time I used this medication, it was very effective with no side effects and after 3 days
of taking it, I noticed considerable improvement and then by the time the perscription was totally consumed, probably 10 days worth, the Strep throat was gone and all cleared up.  It was the second occasion of treating a similar illness that the side effects were detected. After one day of taking the cipro- so probably had 3 pills, I began to get an itchy rash mostly on my arms, legs, and abdomen.  There were small red dots that itched.  I also noticed that my throat swelled up and
it was getting harder to breath.  I called my Dr. and was told to quit taking the Cipro and an alternative

My cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my HDL/LDL ratio was poor. Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss. Surprisingly no side effects with Crestor even though it is the most potent of the statins. I had severe muscle pains with Lipitor and other statins and expected to have the same problems with Crestor. For some reason I didn't have these problems with Crestor. I was started on 10mg and retested after 10 weeks. My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped significantly, HDL rose slightly and triglyserides dropped slightly (they were already in the normal range before). My liver enzymes were high before taking Crestor but had returned to normal when retested after 10 weeks (I don't know if Crestor had anything to do with this or not). Blood sugar levels were normal before and after taking Crestor, but slightly lower after. I am due to be tested again before the end of this year and also have a Cardio Stress Test.

metrogel,1,"metrogel rosacea - I never got pimples, pustules, or anything else associated with this condition.  But maybe I never would have--it is hard to say.

The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics. Hard to say.  

During the fifteen years I took it, my pores enlarged and became clogged.  That may have been due to age and other factors--but I could not help but suspect that some of the heavy waxes and oils used in the product may have contributed.

Metrogel left an ashy white residue, so I switched to the cream.  Maybe the gel would have less clogging effect.  

Later, I got prescription insurance coverage and had to take a generic, which may have had even cheaper inactive ingredients. I never had a problem with rosacea.  I went to a dermatologist and was kept waiting two hours.  I was embarrassed because I kept literally falling asleep in the waiting room.  I asked the receptionist if I had time to run out and get a cup of coffee.  After I drank the coffee, my cheeks flushed bright red--that was the only symptom of rosacea.

After fifteen years and several changes of dermatologists, I got a new doctor and asked if the metronidazole could be causing enlarged pores.  When she found out that I never had pimples or pustules, she suggested I try not using the metronidazole at all.  I have not used it for the last six weeks and I see no change.

lamictal,8,"lamictal mood stabilization - The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical. There were no side effects.  If there were,(which I don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. Some people say they are the type that has all the side effects.

However, I found it made me so tired, that I took half a pill in the morning and half at night. Now my body has adjusted a lot, I am only on half the dose I started with. I also take a baby aspirin daily. I rely on Atacand to keep my blood pressure stable.

He also prescribed a codeine syrup that make me incredibly sick to my stomach.  I hated being on all those meds.

The outbreaks that I do have (if, for example, I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in, the sores may still form, but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site. None I get horrible outbreaks in the center of my chin-- usually 5-8 sores clustered together all at once; really awful-looking. I'm aware of the things that trigger them, so when I realize there's a chance I might have an outbreak, even if I haven't felt the tingling yet, I'll take a couple of Valtrex and then I don't have an outbreak at all. I can't say for sure that it's the Valtrex stopping it (i.e. maybe I wouldn't have had an outbreak anyway in some cases) but it seems that way to me, and in any case it's nice to have some sense of control over the situation. Even though my outbreaks are awful, they only happen about 2x/year so I haven't felt it necessary to take the daily preventative pills.",high

Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision. Severe burning sensation in eyes about one minute after applying drops.  This burning sensation did not always occur.  When the burning sensation occurred my eyes were photosensitive so I had to remain in a dark room for about 15 minutes.  I wore dark glasses for about one hour after leaving the dark room.  I put the eye drops in my eyes in the morning and before going to bed at night.  This meant some mornings I would be leaving for work at 6am (quite dark out) with dark glasses on as any amount of light was painful. Had very dry itching eyes.  Difficult to determine if part was allergies.  Was referred to retinal specialist by my eye physician because of severely decreased vision.  Specialist prescribed the restasis and some different eye drops.  Returned in about 6 weeks with distinctly better vision but continued burning and itchy eyes.

There is no alternative treatment if the patient does not feel the benefit. The doctor only sees the blood test to show that the treatment is effective.

I take it at night, so the first 3-4 hours of each morning I experience the above side effects. This is uncomfortable during the first 2-3 weeks, then your body gradually gets used to it. Patient: I had suffered a fall from a vasovagal syncope episode (fainted from a standing position, hit back of head on floor).  It was approximately 6 or 7 months before I was prescribed the Aricept.  The Aricept was prescribed to help the brain repair and re-connect (memory, executive reasoning: strategic planning, options, solutions, implementation, changes and follow-through). 

The side effects were worse the first 2-3 weeks on the 5 mg, then the 4th week, my body appeared to adjust and they became less intense. The 5th week, the doctor moved me up to 10 mg, and the side effects increased again. At that point, he took me off the Aricept and tried a competitors ""patch"" called Exelon. That didn't work well at all and set me back 5-6 weeks cognitively. 

Now I'm back on the 5mg of Aricept for the past 2 weeks and the plan is to stay on that dose for 6 months to a year. The side effects were the same at first, and are now getting better each day.

I read about the drug before using it and I was very hesitant about using it since I heard about all the negative side effects. It didn't seem worth it to take the risk and try it, but I spoke to me Doctor about it. He advised me that if I noticed any of the symptoms, I should stop taking the medicine immediately. I took the chance because I don't want to look back ten (more like two, to be honest)years from now and say, ""Man, I really wish I would have tried it. Maybe it would have worked, I should have at least done my best to fight this monster called baldness."" So I tried it, and I knew almost within the second week that it wasn't for me. I notice all of the side effects and stop taking the medicine. I'm thankful for this website because it gives people the opportunity to be honest and share there experiences. If I had not read some of the comments, I might have continued with the medication and done more damage without knowing it. So thank you. I tried the drug, and realized it wasn't for me. I am very lucky that all of the symptoms have passed and I am back to normal.

cytomel,8,"cytomel hypothyroid - hashimoto's disease - Increased energy and memory.  Levothyroxine treatment alone was not working well.  The combination works much better. None Since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my doctor�s would treat with basically the Levothyroxine.  The levels would be increased until I was �in the range�, but I never felt quite right.  I was still very tired and my memory, especially short-term, was really bad.  I went to a couple endocrinologists, with the first one diagnosing the hypothyroidism as a result of Hashimoto�s disease.  Even with this diagnosis, the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and I continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  I decided to go for a second opinion, and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of Levothyroxine and Cytomel.  This seemed to turn me around.  The memory and tiredness have gotten better, still not optimal.  It seems as long as one is �in the range�, doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.  I would like to see physicians listen to their patients and adjust the meds until they feel better, not just go �by the range�.",high
sarafem,10,"sarafem depression - stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again. none -- no weight loss unfortunately Started with 20 mg once daily. This worked for several years. When spouse endured 3 years of life-threatening illness, the dosage was increased to 40 mg taken as 2 20mg pills.",high
advair-diskus,9,advair-diskus asthmatic bronchitis - I was able to breathe much easier with this inhaler. As far as I know there were none. Was given the inhaler due bronchitis.  It seemed effective along with antibiotics.  I am now breathing fine and have no symptoms of asthma or bronchitis.  This was 3 weeks ago.,high
zoloft,9,"zoloft panic attacks - I have debilitating panic attacks. After I was on Zoloft for a couple of weeks I noticed a substantial difference. I no longer felt the ""looming dread"" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease. I went off of Zoloft on my own in October of 2008. I went down gradually from 50mg to 25 for about a week and then went off completely. The two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. The panic attacks didn't come back but I'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). I also had the strangest, most vivid dreams. I recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea I'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky. My family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. I saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if I have a panic attack. Which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of ANYTHING constructive with your time.",high
xanax,10,"xanax anxiety attacks - It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it. It made me a little bit too sleepy.  It also was relaxing to the point that I felt a little disoriented.  It was a great solution as long as I was at home.  It would not have been practical to take when working, driving, etc. It was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.  I would take the tablet at the onset of the attack.  The attacks usually occured at night, shortly after I feel asleep.",high
dilantin,9,"dilantin seizures - Dilantin provided Control of seizures
(mostly petits) as these were more frequent.
Generally, the drug is still as effective as when
first introduced to me so there has
been little need for increasing the dosage.
It was imperative in my treatment, though, that the drug be NON GENERIC ONLY. Dizziness Limit stimulants, plenty of rest,
reduce stress, take meds",high
zyrtec,8,"zyrtec allergy - Zyrtec helped to control my runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing throughout the spring allergy season. It also proved useful as an antihistamine whenever I had similar symptoms after the normal allergy season (March through April). I did not have any notable side effects during the course of taking the drug. Take one tablet daily during allergy season.",high
wellbutrin-xl,10,"wellbutrin-xl depression - Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like. A small amount of shaking, mainly felt when drinking from a cup. It's not supposed to affect weight and hunger, but I have gained some weight, though I don't know if or how the medicine contributed. Before using Wellbutrin I had trouble getting to sleep, then trouble getting up in the morning. I was very irritable, depressed and frustrated. I always felt groggy and could not 'get it together' until late in the day. When my treatment began, I started by taking one 150 mg pill first thing in the morning for a week. Then I took one 150 mg pill in am and one 150 mg pill in pm (this was before XL came out). The third week and from then on I took 300 mg in morning. I felt so much better that I was not bothered by the slight let down in the evening. However,I didn't feel really well consistently all day until the XL formula came out. I have tried the generic and I don't feel as well and I had constant stomach aches to the point that I was having pain near my gall bladder and was considering being evaluated for gallstones. All of this cleared up when I went back to Wellbutrin XL and I have not had a problem since.",high
wellbutrin-xl,7,"wellbutrin-xl depression - Elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed. None at 300 mg.  Possible tinnitus from increase to 450 mg, not evaluated by an audiologist yet though.  Did experience weight loss (7 lbs.) at 450 mg dosage. Initial treatment included therapy and Lexapro in addition to Wellbutrin XL.  Now only on the Wellbutrin XL.  I see the psychiatrist every 4 months for re-evaluation",high
prilosec,9,"prilosec barretts disease - I was actually throwing up a couple of times a week during the night. Found I had Barretts and the treatment cleared up the Barretts after about 5 years. I have an artifical hip and have constant discomfort where implant was put into femur. I was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about 3 days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. Sometimes when I overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol I get extreme chest pain. I actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. After it subsides which is usually 15 to 20 minutes I will be extremely exhaused.The first time it happened I thought I was actually having a heart attack.So to counter the issue I try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day. I still don't know I the moderate discomfort in my leg is the medication, so I guess I will live with it.I have read a bit about the different symptoms and being a little older its hard to determine if its drugs or age causing some of the issues. I take 20mg everyday before I eat dinner. To me the side effects have been worth it I don't believe I would be here today if I wasn't taking this medication. My dad died of stomach cancer. My brother and sister exhibit the gerd symptoms and are also on the drug now.",high
synthroid,10,synthroid hypothroidism after radioactive iodine - Medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years. When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked. The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. I was given a pill to swallow. I was then asked to come back after 6 hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. I came back the next day for another scan. After one week I had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. I have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. In some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels I have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.,high
humira,9,"humira rheumatoid arthritis - Improved joint stiffness, less fatigue, better mobility, less pain and joint swelling, improved mood because of improved mobility No side effects, possible chronic sinus issues but not sure if it is related. Bruising at injection site One injection sq every week, some pain on injection, occasional mild bleeding at injection site, mild bruising at injection site",high
valtrex,8,valtrex chronic cold sores - The first time I took it the cold sore ended up just slightly smaller than they usually are. The second time it was about 1/2 the size. The third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. The forth time I didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. I used to get them about every 4 to 6 weeks but the last one came about 4 months after the previous one. No side effects at all. You take 4 pills as soon as you can tell the cold sore is beginning and then 4 pills 12 hours later.,high
retin-a-micro,10,"retin-a-micro blackheads,large pores,sun damage - I saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time. The first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and I had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away. I would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry I would apply a small amount of Retin-A to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. The evenings that I did not use Retin-A I would use a good night moisturizer.",high
diclofenac,7,"diclofenac back pain slipped disk - The Ibuprofen gel would enable instant relief as it could be applied topically and carried around easily in ones pocket/bag.
The Diclomax SR tablets tended to work quite quickly therefore providing quick relief. I also used an ice pack which combined with the other treatments mentioned gave me round the clock relief. I experienced stomach pains and bleeding when tablets were taken on an empty stomach.  This was the only side effect I experienced and as long as you can be organised about when you eat and take the tablets then it causes no problems at all.  Given the fact I relied on these tablets for 3 years, the side effects were extremely mild and forgettable. The treatment was for my back pain, this was lower back pain caused by a slipped disk.  I also received cortisone injections which gave little or no relief.  I was prescribed 3 tablets a day of 75mg dosage to take with meals.
I also had to undertake some back strength exercises in order to strengthen the muscles which had wasted away.",high
fioricet,5,"fioricet migraines - It effectively stopped migraine at the ""aura"" stage.  No need to take any additional medications. Massive dizziness/ ""drugged"" feeling.  A feeling of being ""out of it"" --- unable to focus eyes, exhausted, etc.  Impossible to function until the effect wore off.  Not convinced this is the best option for migraine treatment.  Although it was effective, the side effects were almost not worth it.  There have got to be better options out there. Every time more than one pill was taken (where one was ineffective in stopping the progression of a migraine), massive dizziness and drugged feeling would result.",high
synthroid,10,synthroid hypothyroid - with the treatment I feel less tired and more energetic.I comeback to my normal weight and I stop losing my hair. Also I do not get cold as I use to. I did not have any side effects after the doctor find the right dosage I was able to function like I used to before I have the symptoms of the hypothyroid. I take one tablet everyday in the morning in a empty stomach around the same time and I wait an hour before I eat. Sometimes I can only wait 30 minutes and it does not seems to alter the effect of the medication.,high
prednisone,8,"prednisone pneumonia - Opened airways to help breath none. I did have concerns about taking an oral steroid,but was reassured that the short duration would not cause adverse side effects. After a first round of antibiotics and use of arbuterol with a nebulizer with minimal effectiveness, my doctor put me on an oral steroid to open up my airways. Once I started the seroid, I felt 100% better.",high

TABLETS ARE TO BE TAKEN TWICE DAILY FOR AS LONG AS NEEDED.",high
adderall,6,"adderall possible add - The adderall allows me to focus and study better.  I definitely function better while taking it.  I am prescribed to take it ""as needed"" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day, but I rarely have taken that much. If I take a 5 mg pill later than 3 pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  I sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  Sometimes I have strange muscle twitches that I can't control.  Some days it makes me lose my appetite completely, which doesn't sound bad but I'm already a little underweight. Since I control when I take the meds (what time, how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So, even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.  Even with all that, the drug has helped me out more than I can ever explain.",high
lexapro,9,"lexapro depression, ptsd - Severe long term depression and anxiety were alleviated. Yawning, tiredness, lethargy, dry eyes/sinuses. Over time the drug seemed to build up in my system (the Dr. determined that I metabolize this particular drug slowly)and my dosage had to be adjusted to 5mg/day. 5mg/day takes the edge off the depression but does not cause the extreme exhaustion experienced at higher doses.

This medication is excellent despite some mild side effects. It does not cause any of the musculo/skelatal pain or sleep interuptions I experienced with other anti-depressants. treatment began 3 years ago, 20mg/day was adusted to 10mg/day taken at bedtime for 2 and a half years. 4 months ago dosage was decreeased to 5mg/day at bedtime.",high

Affects my skin somewhat (more blemishes, seems to age my skin somewhat) I take 3 Adderall per day. 1 1/2 pill in the morning, and 1 1/2 in the the afternoon.  Each pill is 15 mg.  I break one in half to divide between morning and afternoon.  I see my doctor once every 3 months to discuss how it's working.  I started out on 5mg, 2x/day, but I developed a tolerance to it over time and went from 5 mg/2x day, to 10mg/2x day to 15mg 2x/day to 15mg 3/day.",high
keflex,1,"keflex bladder infections - It did help to control bladder infections. I was 25 at the time and experienced chronic yeast infections while this drug. About 10 years later I had severe bladder pain, but no infection was present. After bladder biopsy it was determined that I had intercystial cystitis and the doctor feels it was from being on this antibiotic long term. I suffered with this condition for 6 years and finally had DMSO bladder washes which relieved the problem greatly. To this day I have bladder pain occasionally. After suffering numerous bladder infections, it was determined that I needed longterm antibiotic treatment to get the problem under control. Six months of Keflex. Because this was 25 years ago I am not sure of the dosage.",Low
seasonale,8,"seasonale birth control - The benefits of Seasonale is that you only have your period once every three months. In my situation, I continually have spot bleeding towards the end of every 30 day cycle which should not occur.  My doctor advised that this would lessen the longer I stay on this medication however, it only improved slighty and I never can make it through the entire 90 days, my period always starts a few days before I've finished the last few pills. You take one pill every day for 90 days, wait 7 days, and then begin the cycle again.",high
periogard,10,"periogard dental surgery - prevented infection of surgically sewn gums.  They cut my gums and pulled them down further over the teeth and added a laboratory grown skin product to make the gum larger.  I also used this periogard bottle when they put caps on my teeth, just to prevent infection. I had no side effects, but was told the product could stain the teeth (which the dentist could alter back to white teeth), however, I wiped my teeth with a wash cloth after swishing with the product. The details were included in the two above sections.",high
atacand,9,"atacand hypertension (high blood pressure) - Effectively lowers blood pressure with very few side effects and NO cough, No drowsiness and no sexual problems of any kind!!! I have had some very mild side effects. Slight nasal congestion (now gone) and an occasional sort of gravelly coarseness to my voice. If they are the only side effects then I am happy to live with that. I had been searching for a drug for hypertension that had the fewest side effects. Every time I saw my doctor it was like I was being a guinea pig for the next lot of side effects and it was really getting me down. So after a little research on the net, I came across this drug and reviews from people who have taken it.
I told and showed my doctor the results and he was happy for me to try this drug and I am glad that I did. Previous drugs gave me an instant irritating cough and also made my feet swell up.
This drug is by far the best I have tried so far and just one 8mg tablet a day does the trick for me!",high

zantac,9,"zantac acid reflux - The ranitidine was very effective in releaving my symptoms of acid reflux.  After several months of treatment my stomach, which previously felt nauseated on a daily basis, felt much better and very rarely caused me discomfort. I didnt seem to have any negative side effects. I am not sure if it is related to the ranitidine but since I began using it I have not contracted any viruses.  In the past I would get 2 or 3 viruses every year.",high
lunesta,8,"lunesta insomnia - Sleeping was possible.  It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away. Bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  However, lineage did not work well at all if I ate anything near bed.  The directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  But, it also did not work if I even took a fish oil supplement, which is a fatty acid.  Even the smallest amount of fat, like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  When that happens, I would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  This is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half! Taken as needed for insomnia.",high
amoxil,8,amoxil infected site of oreal surgery - The infection that developed at the site of my oral surgery subsided and this allowed the wound to begin to heal. None observed. The oral surgeon prescribed amoxicillin as a preventaitive measure after surgery.  I opted not to take a breaod spectrum antibiotic when there was no infection present.  Within 4 days of surgery it was clear that I did have an infection and filled that prescription. I took 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times daily and took probiotics at least two hours after each dose of antiobiotics to replace the body's good bacteria.  After a few days the infection cleared.  I finished the whole course as directed.,high

androgel,10,"androgel male andropause - Extremely better clarity of mind.  Much higher energy.  More strength.  More optimism.  More vigor. At first I didn't realize that it was significantly converting to DHT and causing typical male pattern hairloss.    Once I realized it was happening, I was able to slow it down greatly via a shampoo designed to block DHT (not systematically, just on the scalp). Rub gel on forearms twice per day.  Extremely easy.",high
finacea,9,"finacea acne - I started using Skinoren along with a treatment of benzoil peroxide and alpha hydroxy lotion as part of a regimen to attempt to clear up ongoing, stubborn adult acne. within about five or six days my skin started clearing up. My skin was already accustomed to high-percentage AHA products, so any stinging scaling or irritation were minimal. After a few days I had no side effects. Nightly, I would put a small amount of Skinoren, Benzoil Peroxide and an AHA cream (with a 10% AHA)in the palm of my hand and combine, and apply to face nightly. The rest of my regimen included a very gentle face cleanser, and a mild and light moisturizer during the day along with an application of the 10% AHA lotion.",high

minocycline,1,"minocycline acne - Decreased the number of acne lesions. Major Headaches
Neck Pain I have been taking minocycline 100mg twice a day. At first I had no side effects what so ever. However after a week I started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. It was when I started having neck pains, I stopped using Minocycline. Although I stopped using it, I never thought the pains were due to it - I thought it was from going out right after the shower which I often do. That same night I woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) At first I thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (White blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)

During the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) I was taking steroid pills for allergies and I got back to normal within 5 days. On the 8th day, I was like hmm lets take minocycline again, I wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. I took one pill at night after 8 days of not using it, and the next day I got itchy hands and a few hives and then I realized it was the minocycline that I was reacting to. Luckily I only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and I am back to normal again.



So around 8-9 days later after I gave blood, the results came to my doctor. To my surprise everything came normal no allergies what so ever, no pollen, no nuts, no nuts, no dust completely NO ALLERGIES. My Red Blood cell count along with hematocrit came a little high but nothing else.

There were none - all I felt was better. I took 100 mg Levoxyl, which provides a thyroid hormone called T4. It's success depends on the body's ability to convert T4 to T3; adding Cytomel proves T3 (the active hormone) directly. I now take 10 mcg Cytomel along with 100 mg Levoxyl and symptoms of low thyroid have resolved.",high

alendronate,6,"alendronate osteopenia - I have taken this drug for four years, with a hiatus of about 1 year because I was afraid of dire side affects that had been widely advertised, having to do with the deterioration of jaw bone. The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia, as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program, using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication, thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However, the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help. I have a bad taste in my mouth the day I take the alendronate medication and worry about side-affects, including long-term side affects which are undetectable currently. I take the medication 1/wk.  I also run or walk daily.",high
adderall-xr,4,"adderall-xr add - To treat add.  To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships. I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea. I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then, throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However, I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.",Low

wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl depression - This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip, I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a ""stiff upper lip"" my husband noticed the change. At the beginning of treatment I noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and I felt a bit jittery.  However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression. Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs, physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).  Overall I would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and I feel is appropriate for me.",high
celebrex,9,"celebrex post shoulder surgery pain - Reduced the pain. no noticeable side effects. Started taking right after surgery. I had to subsequent surgeries during the following 5 months. Was taking in conjunction with narcotics right after surgery and for a week or so, then only the Celebrex. After about one year, it was reduced down to once a day. I noticed if I didn't take the medication my shoulder would consistantly ache at about a 3-4 out of 10 pain scale. With the medication, I would rate the pain as 0-1, not really noticeable, but still there.",high
synthroid,10,"synthroid low thyroid production - I had Graves disease in 1990 which indicated that my thyroid function was way too high.  The symptoms were anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and restlessness. I was administered an uptake test and I received radioactive iodine therapy to slow down my thyroid function.  This threw me into a state of low thyroid function.  Synthoid balances my thyroid function to normal and the negative symptoms disappeared. None See my description under ""treatment benefits""",high

chantix,7,"chantix nicotine addiction - I had smoked for 20 years and despite repeated quit attempts using Zyban (bupropion), nicotine patches (and nicotine gum, lozenges etc), I had never managed to stay quit for long. Chantix enabled me to quit my 10 cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment I really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore. I was nauseated after taking each tablet. The nausea started about 20 minutes after taking the tablet and lasted for about 30 minutes. I was never physically sick and the nausea was bearable.
I had greatly reduced libido and difficulty getting and sustaining an erection. My orgasm was delayed, diminished and not satisfying. Sexual function returned to normal when I finished the Chantix course.
I had difficulty sleeping and felt fatigued throughout the treatment.
All things considered, the side effects were worth it for the benefits. As smoking causes premature death a few side effects are a reasonable trade off in order to quit. Standard treatment regime. 0.5mg on day 1, then 0.5mg BD up till day 8, then 1mg BD till 3 months. Gave up smoking on day 10 though smoking had lost most of its appeal by day 7.",high
zyvox,9,"zyvox mrsa - It cured the MRSA. Major downside was high price. The resulting yeast infection was a bit irritating but not unexpected.I would highly recmmend zyvox to anyone with this particular strain of MRSA. Yeast infection and minor queasiness. Pill form, 2 a day. It was pretty simple. I had been receiving it in the hospital as a drip (liquid).",high
micardis,4,"micardis high blood pressure - the doctor prescibed this drug to help with my blood pressure problem. it was moderately high, around 140/100, but I didn't like the side effects.

metformin,4,"metformin diabetes - lowered blood sugar readings some what. Generally speaking I feel it has few benefits, however I feel it may have some way balanced my hormones... increased my sex drive I think but not sure. diarrhea and some upset stomach Blood sugar dropped by 50% with increase exercise and limiting high glycemic food intake. I felt that the metaformin is playing a minor role in this.",Low

When med was not taken, an unusual sensation (electric?) would shoot thru brain. one tablet daily in the a.m.",high
lexapro,7,"lexapro anxiety - I thought the medication did an okay job.  My anxiety never entirely disappeared, but there was a noticeable reduction.  The medication would probably have been more effective had it been combined with a talking therapy, but it was not. The treatment had no significant side effects, aside from a little bit of nausea during the initial day or two.  None of the more serious effects listed on the bottle were ever a problem. Basically, I had anxiety attacks and was prescribed Lexapro.  I took the pill once a day every day for about a year, when I was weaned off.  Apparently, if you don't wean yourself, you can experience withdrawal.",high
renova,7,renova adult acne - Improved skin condition. Blackheads are noticibly smaller and the the pores are not as noticeable.  Fine wrinckles have been minimized. My skin is no longer so oily which I like. Minimal flaking if a few days of application was missed. A bit more sensitiveness to other creams that have hydroxy acids.

strattera,9,"strattera adhd - I am more able to stay on task and finish what I start.   I don't make so many mistakes in the details of my work.  I am more able to concentrate consistantly on a project and not get so easily distracted.  I am more confident that my work will be done well and in a timely manner. When I first started taking it, I felt odd.  I can't describe it except to say I felt out of sorts.  I had trouble with perspiring and being cold and overly warm.  I would feel cold inside and chilled sometimes and then I'd feel very warm and start to perspire. I'm taking this because I have trouble with details.  Things like where I parked my car.  I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water and open the refrigerator.  I come out of a business and walk around aimlessly because I have no clue where my car is.  Things are much better now, I rarely have occurrences like this any more.",high

doxycycline,8,"doxycycline acne with cystic fibrosis genetic condition - Cleared up my Acne Vulgaris (acne turned into a big boil) and also coincidentally helped manage my lung condition. Usually I take ciprofloxacin 750mg twice a day, two weeks on and two weeks off for my CF, in addition to Azithromycin 250mg every day..BUT when I am off the Cipro i find that my lung condition very gradually deteriorates when I am not on Cipro. My finding was that when I was off the Cipro, and on the Doxycycline, the Doxycycline happen to help ""maintain""or slow down the exacerbation of my lung condition. YES. Besides being more suceptable to sunburn, being in a tropical climate i felt I was VERY much more suceptable to heat exhaustion symptoms. I overcame this by taking double dosage of Salt tablets, and wearing a wet/cool towel around my neck to prevent the sun exposure on back of my neck. Wore a hat at all times also. Doxycycline 100mg twice a day, after meals, with no milk for 1 mour before or after. To helpe with side effects I took 16-22 salt tablets per day (being in a tropical climate) plus panadol 2 tablets twice a day after meals. I found the panadol helped manage the symptoms of vertigo (mild dizzyness). I felt the panadol in low dosages also helped me recover quicker from excercise.",high
prochlorperazine,2,"prochlorperazine nausea - i was experiencing nausea without vomiting. The doctor prescribed stemetil 3x daily.  The first day the nausea was largely alleviated by the taking the stemetil. The second day of taking stemetil i began to experience unpleasant anxiety and a  cramping sensation in my muscles, particularly my arms. This worsened throughout the day and I found myself uncontrollably flexing my muscles and not being able to control it. My GP prescribed stemetil for the nausea associated with a migraine. 5 mg x 3 a day. After experiencing the symptoms as described above, I returned to the Doctor.  He injected me with something? which counteracted the uncontrollable cramping I was experiencing.",Low
lac-hydrin,5,"lac-hydrin extremely dry skin - It was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines. During the 6 months during which I used the Lac-hydrin, I didn't experience any negative side-effects. I was using it during winter months, so I don't have any feedback to offer on sun-sensitivity. I didn't experience any additional skin irritation that lessened my interest in the product. I simply moved on to other products because of the price. The Lac-hydrin was applied topically to all parts of my body (expect my face) twice daily. My dermatologist recommended that one of the applications be directly after my shower. The skin will retain moisture from the shower for a bit, and the application of the Lac-hydrin will help to keep it there. I would reapply to dry skin again before bed.",high

After one year reduced the doseage by 25% per day and noticed some lessening in side effects.,high
vytorin,1,"vytorin high cholesterol - None.  My LDL level did not drop. My ck levels jumped to 480, bruising without trauma, loss of memory, lapses of time up to 4 hours, significant pain in legs which kept me awake at night, made my legs jump.  My left leg contorted during a spasm, my foot turned out which couldn't be straigntened without help and masssge of the calf and foot. Cholesterol levels are high with genetic factors.  LDL  170, HDL 80, total 276.  The cardiologist used Vytorin as first and only treatment.  My diet contained <20% fat intake, almost no saturated fat.  I had pain in my legs within weeks, informed the doctor who checked my ck levels.  Lab showed ""within normal range"" and I was told to resume the vytorin.  Within 3 weeks the pain was unmanagable, so I called the doctor again.  The nurse said I had to put up with a little discomfort but I insisted on another lab.  Lab resulted in ck levels of 480, I was told to stop the vytorin and drink a lot of water.  I changed cardiologist at that time.",Low
avita,9,"avita skin aging/sun damage - Within 4 days my skin became visibly smoother, pore size was markedly reduced very quickly and after just a few weeks there was increased firmness and generally younger looking skin. Crows feet and forehead lines also diminshed. Skin strength was greatly improved and I did not need to where make-up to hide imperfections as much, my skin looked more polished. None A dermatologist prescribed Retinova and told me that the longer I used it, the better the results would be. This proved to be correct. He told me to mix a pea sized portion with my usual moisturiser but to only use it once a day, I used it at night. He also stipulated that it was very important to use an effective sun block as Retinova increased sensitivity to sunlight. A number of people commented on the improvement in my skin. After about 12 months a large, brown patch of sun damage on my temple flaked off and didn't come back. I was very disappointed when I went to get my usual 3 month prescription and was told that Retinova was no longer available. I have subsequently used Retin-A but without the same visible results. This wasn't prescribed by the original dermaltologist, he didn't believe Retin-A was suitable for what I wanted to achieve for my skin. Over the counter products containing retinol do help smoothness a little, but nothing compared to the dramatic changes I experienced when I used Retinova. What amazed me the most was how quickly some of the changes occurred, within only a matter of days.",high
propecia,8,"propecia hairloss - With using generic finasteride there's no doubt that further hairloss has been prevented in my case.  Before beginning on this, my hairloss was rapidly escalating, both at the front and back, and this ceased and slightly reversed once started, and hasn't progressed since. Definitely loss of libido, tiredness, some fogginess of thought, loss of muscle tone, occasional testicular pain, lowered blood pressure, increased floaters in vision, some gynecomastia when cycling down (minimised by taking Zinc on those days, but I would say not to discontinue this medication suddenly if taking a break or quitting). Mostly generic Proscar - 5mg tablets cut into six equal pieces - 4 days on and one day off in a continuing cycle.",high
allegra,6,"allegra allergies - Less sneezing, headaches, and stuffy noses. Sometimes, extreme drowsiness. Other than making me drowsy, this stuff is great, while it works.  The problem I'm having is that I'm only allowed one pill per day and that pill wears off after 12 hours EVERY DAY.  Then, I'm back to being miserable, again. :(",high
retin-a-micro,10,"retin-a-micro acne - I started using Retin-A after the birth of my second child when I broke out with
adult acne.  At the time it was not advertised as an anti aging cream and as I was only 26 or so I really wasn't concerned about wrinkles. Because of the warning of photosensitivity increase to sun exposure I used sunscreen daily (I lived in Tampa,FL). Now at the age of 62 I have gorgeous skin. Yes, I LOVE products but my basic regimen has not changed. Cleansing,Sunscreen and Retinol-A
at bedtime. I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation. The humidity in Florida helped so much in building up tolerance for the drying effect of Retin-A. I had to be extremely careful NOT to introduce any other strong product AHA or Gylgolic Acid and washing once daily with mild cleanser (Cetaphil). Once Retin-A Micro was introduced to the public I switched and I literally can smear it everywhere around my nose and lips and close to my eyes with no problem. However I do not use Retin A in cold dry climates or on vacations because of the changes in atmosphere and environment. Nightly use pea size amount. Wait 20 minutes after exposure to water (cleansing)

xyrem,10,"xyrem insomnia - After suffering with chronic insomnia for the majority of my adult life, and after all of the popular sleep meds failed, I found Xyrem and it has changed my life. I am now in control of when I go to sleep and when I wake. The depression (Beck Index: 28) vanished after 3 weeks of treatment (Beck Index: 5). Anxiety has also abated. Loss of fat, increase in muscle size and strength. Improved energy. Improved interaction with friends and family. During the first 2 weeks there was stomach irritation, increased sweating at night, and diminished appetite.  All have abated now. I take 3.25g at bedtime, usually 10:30 PM.  This normally produces sleep until about 2:00 AM. I then take another 2.75g dose and sleep until 5:30 AM.  On average, I get 5.5 to 7 hours of sleep and it is the best sleep I have ever known.  I no longer stay awake for days on end and I never have to come home on my lunch break to nap.  

With the exception of the outrageous price, Xyrem is an amazing treatment for insomnia.  It is a shame that the media has turned such a wonderful treatment into an evil 'date rape drug'.",high
vioxx,3,"vioxx possible arthritis - Don't believe that I took it long enough to really tell if it was working. I had an allergic reaction shortly after I started taking it. My upper lip swelled up an became rough an mildly itchy. It remained rough and swollen for a week. For another week it just felt ""weird"". There was some  crustiness around my mouth. Hadn't eaten or taken anything else orally that was new to me. I don't remember the details, but I did follow the prescription directions to the letter. Did not take more than was prescribed to me and took it in the prescribed manner.",Low
paxil,7,"paxil anxiety - Totally reduced anxiety around presenting information to groups.  Made it possible to think clearly and give an effective class. Dopey feeling, extreme fatique, procrastination, numb feeling. My MD perscribed the medication for some increasingly intense feelings of anxiety around presenting to certain groups of people in higher levels of management.  I was hoping for something that I could take only on a ""as needed"" basis as I've never been one to take medication unless absolutely needed.  My MD does not believe in prescribing that kind of medication due to the highly addictive nature. I do not like the side effects of this drug and do not intend to continue it.",high

zoloft,10,"zoloft anxiety - I have seen a great improvement since taking Zoloft.  I am a classic type A person and tend toward anxiety when I have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work. I need to take my dose with breakfast.  If not, I feel nauseous.  This hasn't been a huge issue, since I eat breakfast regularly.  However, if I take a pill and eat immediately, I feel sick to my stomach.  The only other issue I have had is that I feel dizzy if I miss a dose.  I am good at remembering to take my morning dose, so this does not happen often.   Also, I did go off Zoloft a couple of years ago because I wanted to reduce the number of drugs I was taking.  Although I gradually reduced my dosage, I had a difficult time when I finally went completely off.  I felt dizzy and suffered a couple of bouts of vertigo. I take 75 mg in the morning.  Zoloft was prescribed to me by a family practice physician when I was 41 years old. The first 18 months that I took Zoloft, my dosage was 100 mg.  I took a break for about 2 years and asked my physician abbout going back on Zoloft last year, when I turned 45.  I was experiencing mood swings right before my period and, in doing research on the internet, learned that this could be due to my age.  One recommendation was treating the symptoms with zoloft or another prescription drug.  My physcian started me on 50 mg, and I went up to 75 mg after a few months of taking Zoloft.",high
synthroid,7,"synthroid s/p thyroidectomy - Treatment benefits consisted of weight gain after pronounced weight loss due to thyroid tumor.  Although the patient felt that there was a greater weight gain than she desired. A greater than desired weight gain and a decrease in energy and libido are the most bothersome side effects as per the patient.  The dose is still being titrated in order to moderate these effects. Post thyroidectomy, the patient was placed on Levothyroxin 120 mcg, but the patient complained of pronounced weight, lack of energy, lack of sex drive and some depression.  Blood work was done and the dose has been adjusted to 100 mcg and will be re-evalutated in 2 months.",high
propecia,5,"propecia hair loss - Hair loss almost stopped, although minor loss continued. A difficulty in concentration, or 'mind fog', reduced visual acuity, fatigue, and an increased libido, which I didn't realise was due to the drug until I stopped taking it after 5 years. Symptoms disappeared after stopping the drug. I took Propecia (Finasteride) for 5 years, and then stopped. I started taking the drug again recently because my hair loss greatly accelerated after stopping the initial treatment, however, the adverse symptoms returned immediately, and so I again stopped taking the drug.",high

I've been taking Zomig for over a decade and won't go anywhere without them. The side effects were not that bad at all.  I'm a bit tired but nothing I would complain about.  When the headache pain is gone, a little bit of tiredness is nothing to me. I suffered with migraines since I've been 22 years old and now I'm 59. No matter what medication I tried, it never took the pain away. A little over 10 years ago, I had a severe migraine while I was at an Acupunturist for a back treatment and asked him if he could do anything for my migraine and after giving him more information he came to the conclusion that my migraines are hormone related and he couldn't help.  He gave me a sample of Zomig and told me to try it and IT WORKED!!!  I was in awe and called him immediately to thank him for introducing me to this drug.  I've been taking it since.",high

lexapro,8,"lexapro depression - I felt more stable in my daily activities; more capable of handling stress; and better able to successfully complete my daily responsibilities of working nights, parenting three children and keeping a house running at an acceptable level. While I was taking the medicine, I slept alot during the day.  It could have been a side effect of my depression; however, I felt it was from the Lexapro because it was more extreme in the beginning of my takning this medicine and subsided somewhat after the medicine had been in my system for a while.  No matter how much I slept, I never felt rested and could still sleep a full night also.  This could also be attributed to my working night shift; however, once I quit taking the Lexapro, the need to sleep so much during the day subsided. I was prescribed 10mg initially and this was not enough so my dose was increased to 15mg.  I would occasionally take an additional 5 mg, totalling 20mg, but this was rare.  I eventually weaned myself off of the medicine.  My doctor said that it would be acceptable for me to do this myself as I felt ready; largely because my father had died and my mother had remarried and we both felt it was going to be a temporary need only.  I took Lexapro for approximately 6-8 months.",high

Once, after about 3-4 years of usage I had an abnormal blood test and was told to stop taking methotrexate for a month, then re-take blood test. Upon normal test, went back to taking methotrexate as usual. Did not notice any effects during time of abnormal blood test. Injected myself in the thigh once a week.",high

valium,10,"valium anxiety - After intolerable side effects of an anti depressant it relaxed my stomach (stopped vomiting) relaxed muscles so constant shaking and shivering subsided,helped me sleep and for me to actually have normal and relaxed thoughts.

Taken when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that Slight mental and phyical sedation (positive effect for me but be careful if you need to be alert e.g driving)

Slight mental fog for couple of hours on a higher dose (i wouldn't choose this particular benzodiazepine if I felt anxiety at work as I wouldn't be able to concentrate up to the standard required.) But perfect for every other situation. It's long lasting nature often means that if I am experiencing anxiety only one dose is enough to last through the night into the next day... and often it seems as though the body remembers and stores this relaxation so another dose is not necessary. 

I only take when needed which can mean I go months without a dose... this is important as for me personally if I see valium and other benzodiazepine drugs as a long term / life treatment its vital not to become addicted and dependant as this not only means needing a drug to function (shackled by a drug rather than using its benefits when really needed.)

But if your body has constant daily dosing for months or years your brain stopped producing natural relaxation chemicals meaning that you need more and more of the drug to get the same benefit and also because of this after years of high dosage extreme withdrawal symptoms can occur while the brain starts to produce these chemicals again.",high
ambien-cr,9,ambien-cr insomnia - more restful sleep. which helped me to be more alert during the day and less nervous and paniky thinking about my inability to sleep at night knowing I had to work the next day. slight groginess the first couple of days but other than that I actually felt more awaken because the sleep I received was deeper and allowed for me to be more restful when I awoke. 1 tab at night when needed one hour before bedtime.,high
abilify,8,"abilify bipolar - I had severe depression with agitation and mixed-state bipolar hypomania. I was insomniac. I took abilify 5mg for 3 mos, and then I upped it to 10mg. I became drowsy, however, with adequate sleep (10 hrs) there were no hangover effects, unlike zyprexa, for instance. I also experienced some cognitive blunting- that is to say that I could not think very well on my feet the abilify decreased the need for daily klonopin. When I went off of it, I tapered down to 5mg for 4 weeks, then quit altogether. I had racing thoughts when I stopped, but these gradually diminished over several weeks. I also experienced about two months of hypomania, but this was goal-directed and positive for my functioning.",high

vicodin,10,"vicodin pain relief - toothache - Acute pain in tooth subsided normally within 30 minutes, and the relief lasted 6-8 hours.  Allowed me to sleep the entire night without being awakened by the return of pain.

I was later prescribed Codeine after the procedure, which only dulled the pain to half intensity. Mild drowsiness accompanied by a sense of well-being or euphoria.  Side effects were enjoyable, so I was especially careful to take it only as needed to reduce risk of dependency.  The combined effect of pain relief and ""nice feelings"" make this a risky drug to take if you are susceptible to addiction. Prescribed by my dentist to ease pain until I could have a problematic wisdom tooth extracted.  Received 30 tablets to be taken as needed for pain.  I took a half tablet when the pain was less severe and a whole one when I thought pain might interrupt sleep.

My back went out suddenly one day and I was unable to stand or walk without excruciating pain.  I took the last two Vicodin in one dose and the moment I was able, went to a clinic where the doctor chastized me for having a narcotic.  The onset of pain relief was rapid, the side effects took longer to present, but when they did, they were more marked.  Same amount of drowsiness, heavy limbs, and a trance-like state.",high
propecia,10,"propecia male pattern baldness - It effectively slowed my hair loss dramatically. My barber of 15 years says my hair has not changed. I notice slight loss over the years, but I still have a lot of hair whereas I would most certainly be bald without it! None The cost is prohibitive for many. I took Propecia for many years (with great results) until I went to a new doctor and he offered to prescribe it's generic counterpart Finasteride. It costs about $30 for a six months supply compared to Propecia @ $85 for a one month supply. The only drawback is that the pill only comes in 5mg, so you have to cut it into 5 doses of 1mg. For that kind of savings it was no problem for me and it's been working for me for about 5 years! If your doctor won't do it, fire him/her as they are probably on the payroll of big pharma!",high
zoloft,10,zoloft anxiety - Completely eliminated anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and generalized anxiety after dosage of 50 mg/day was taken.  Downsside was that while on 25 mg/day start up dose for the first  7 days anxiety was extremely worsened and almost unbearable. Initial weight loss Patient taking 50 mg/day for generalized anxiety disorder and panic attacks.  Initial start up dose 25 mg/day for 7 days.

lamictal,7,"lamictal bipolar ii - My head felt very clear for the first time in years. I didn't get rattled as easily. Mood stabilizer is a very good description of it. I was able to get motivated, and not feel the world was ending every time something went wrong. I lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion. Unfortunately I developed the much feared rash, and had to discontinue. I had recently started Cymbalta, so I can't be sure it was the Lamictal that set me off, but the psychiatrist didn't want to risk it. I did have to change the timing of the dose to bedtime, as it made me a bit tired shortly after I took it. Also, I believe it affected my vision, which got a bit blurry sometimes. I spent years shuttling between SSRI's, which I know know were the key element in tipping me into mania several times. After the psychiatrist determined the problem was BiPolar 2, the first treatment she considered was Lamictal. I did get some headaches at first, and unfortunately, at some point the effects were negated by the addition of Adderal. Once the Adderal was stopped, it was all good again. I would recommend this drug to anyone, with the proviso that if the SJS rash shows up, you must stop it immediately. Despite that, I really feel it is worth trying.",high
fosamax,5,"fosamax osteroporosis - there were none that I know. Still has osteroposis.  Had to stop because of the stomacjh effect. Developed atrial fibrillation of the heart.  going to shock heart into proper rhythm.  Looked down her throat with a camera to see if there was any blood clots around her heart.  Ruptured her esophagus.  Never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus, weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. When fixed, there was no more pain in the stomach.  She is alright now--but almost died from this See above for treatment details as I don't know what more I could say.  She is healthy now from this.  Fosamax and this type of drugs are not very good for some people.",high
alprazolam,10,"alprazolam anxiety - Anxiety greatly diminished shortly after taking alprazolam.  The alprazolam was also effective in calming the mind prior to sleep.  I have taken alprazolam for anxiety attacks, worrisome and obsessive thinking and in order to fall asleep. I noticed no adverse side effects other than an occassional grogginess the next day after taking it at night.

zoloft,7,"zoloft ibs, panic attacks, depression - Panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where I am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS. After taking drug for 4 months I developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body, causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  These only occurred when I lay down - usually when I was in bed, but didn't occur when I was up and about moving around. I gave up taking Sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious, it started to interfere with my sleep.  The condition took around 2 months to completely disappear.",high

flexeril,6,flexeril upper back / left shoulder and neck pain - Not sure if it is effective or not.  Pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  I am virtually unable to function by evening.  I think I may ask my physician to prescribe an additional 5mg to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon. Slight grogginess in the AM. Starting PT in 2 days.  Currently on Flexeril QD HS x 5 days.,high
lidocaine,10,"lidocaine nerve and muscle pain - Almost immediate (i.e. within 15 minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. These patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  I have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  Chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. I use them only as a last resort. Relief of pain!  No bad side effects. Although the packaging indicates that up to 3 Lidoderm patches can be used at one time for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period, I have never used more then two patches, and then only rarely.  I usually use one patch and cut it into several pieces to fit specific areas. I have used one patch, cut into 2 pieces on my neck for up to 24 hours several times (i.e. replaced the first patch with a second at the end of a 12 hour period) during severe pain episodes, without any harmful side effects.",high
prevacid,7,"prevacid severe heartburn - Overall acid reduction; however, it could be sporadic.  With taking the medication, still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.

depo-provera,10,"depo-provera birth control - I was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (No children, yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus, I no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms, either.  I can not complain about this drug at all. I have not experienced any side effects from this medication.  Losing my period was an anticipated side effect, and although many feel that this is too much for them and discontinue use of this drug, it is a good side effect for me.  Also there are studies that show bone mineral density is affected by this drug, but I have undergone a bone density scan, with normal results.  This is great, considering I have been on Depo for nine years now, since I turned nineteen and for most of my twenties. This drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year, by a physician.  The shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  Besides being used as birth control, it is also used to treat other conditions.",high

Since then I have slept only for about 12 hours (in six days), a nauseous feeling in my stomach with dizziness, stomach cramps, a permanent knot in my stomach, shivers, tremors and sweats, I am worried about itching starting  now.  The good news is that I am less fuzzy in my head even though I am tired, my bladder control is back and I seem to be losing some of the 3/4 stones I have gained since taking the drug.  Today I took half a tablet just to function in my job I was prescribed one tablet daily along with eye drops and a nasal spray, over seven years ago.",high
xanax,1,"xanax anxiety attacks - At first I loved this drug. Panic attacks were getting under control and I didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed. There were no side effects that I noticed at the time. Sadly, you can't (or shouldn't) take a drug like Xanax forever. So eventually, after using it for four months, I stopped. OMG. Would someone please explain to me whose brilliant idea it was to create a drug that when you stop taking it, causes the same symptoms that it was designed to alleviate to begin with?!?! I ended up going through even worse panic attacks after stopping the drug than I had to begin with! So in spite of the fact that it worked great to begin with, I would NEVER take this medication again. All in all it turned out to be a terrible experience.

prednisone,8,"prednisone ulcerative colitis - I never really had any complications with my disease. It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time. I had dry eyes, trouble gaining weight, and loss of energy. My doctor had me start out by taking 6 tablets a  day, three at breakfast and three at dinner.

This was very uncomfortable, enough to disturb sleep at night. Solodyn also makes skin sensitive to the sun, so I had to remember to apply sunscreen every day, with at least a moderate SPF (SPF 30+). Healing and resolution of the folliculitis seemed slow, taking months. I took one Solodyn each day. I also washed my hair and scalp with Clobex shampoo, and applied Mupirocin ointment directly to the lesions.",high

emsam,9,"emsam chronic ""atypical"" depression - I have been on every SSRI made- trial after disappointing trial since I was 19. This is the first medication that has worked for any length of time. (Paxil worked for a short period of time but maxed out w/o further benefit even with augmentation). The worst side effect I had was insomnia. At first, insomnia was OK because I was, for the first time, happy to be alive and being happy more hours of the day seemed hunky-dory. Of course sleep-deprivation isn't good for the brain and started to wear on my job performance. Tried many different sleep agents to no avail.

I'm up to 4-5 hours (pre-med normal amount) without any sleep meds. No response to 6 mg, slight response to 9 mg, full response to 12 mg. I have adhered to none of the MAOI dietary restrictions (eat a lot of soy as a vegetarian, drink 2-3 tap beers upon occasion) with no adverse effect.

I am only 15 and wanted to not have to fight acne for the rest of my teen years. I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

Just keep lotion and chapstick handy, and you'll be fine. the doctors started me off on high dosage and gradually reduced it.  usually, it's two or three pills a day with meals.  also, one drawback is the monthly blood tests and dermatologists visits.  they are time-consuming, but worth it.",high

lexapro,1,"lexapro anxiety - Initially, Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better. Although some stress was alleviated, I noticed that I spent more time in a ""vegetative"" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that. It has taken me two long horrific years to get back on track. I am now approaching my issues naturally and am doing better (not to say this completely stopped my life - but it did seriously change it). I took approximately 5mg a day. I visited my doctor on monthly basis, and was in contact with her via phone during first several weeks (my doc was old school... she really cares about her patients).

chantix,10,"chantix smoking cessation - Quit smoking in 90 days Nausea, Insomnia, Constipation, Erectile Dysfunction, Irritability, Fatigue I have taken Chantix for 6 months and would recommend this cessation method to anyone who is motivated to quit smoking! EVEN if you have a slight desire to quit then this drug is for you BUT only if the following conditions apply: 
1) you are in good mental health 
2) you are not in a high stress environment (I mean like combat or fight fires for a living) 
3) you can accept feeling uncomfortable for about 2 weeks while your body adjusts to the drug.

If you are seeing someone for mental issues then this drug is not for you! If you are in a high stress environment then leave this drug alone! If you cannot handle nausea, constipation, insomnia, or fatigue for extended periods of time then DO NOT take this drug.  The nausea will fade but it can get pretty intense and that seems to be the deal breaker for a lot of people -- I can hack a lot before I ""cry Uncle"", but let me tell you the nausea will come in waves and will wear you down.

Experienced anxiety attacks in the first 2 weeks but then they went away.   Increased dose to 100mg twice a day, auras decreased to 1-2 per month all was well for about 6 years. Began to notice dizziness while walking or looking down, but nothing debilitating.  After 6 years, anxiety attacks sharply increased along with dizziness.

At the beginning of treatment, I had a tremendous difficulty sleeping and felt jittery. Passed after a fews weeks. Definite drop in libido since treatment started, rated the side effects as ""moderate"" above for this reason alone. Take 20 mgs once per day.

effexor-xr,8,"effexor-xr anxiety, mild depression - Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex). Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache. My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes. I was told it would take a week. I reduced the dosage to 75 mg then 37.5 mg after six months because I felt those doses to be too strong. I know others that found this drug helpful. Others it had no effect on at all, even at doses of 300 mg.",high
bystolic,10,"bystolic heart palpitations - I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded. The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.  With Bystolic there is very little of this type of side effect.  Sometimes I don't notice it at all. I take 2.5mg of Bystolic one time per day to control palpitations.  This drug is commonly prescribed for hypertension but I do not take it for that.  At this dose it does not lower my already low blood pressure very much but it is effective against the palpitations.",high

mirtazapine,9,"mirtazapine anxiety and depression - Mirtazapine was very effective in treating chronic insomnia. I was not sleeping due to severe anxiety and moderate depression. The drug has significantly improved anxiety symptoms and is gradually lifting mood and reducing depression symptoms First week I experience fairly bad nausea, first month I was sluggish and tired and head felt ""foggy"" but persistence and going to a full dose resolved all of the problems.

There was some relief after a couple of days on this drug. However, some days I felt as poorly as I did without them.  But after approximately 8 weeks almost all of the discomfort was gone.  I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.  I probably feel the urge less than I did before I had this problem. Dry mouth if I fast from food.  If I eat normally this does not happen.  Other than that, no side effects.

After taking the medication, these problems were aliviated. reduced overall emotional output - before taking Lexapro, i would have episodes of hyperactive behaivour, and would be very outgoing, loud and extatic. I injoyed these, and felt they were part of my personality. This was dumbed down dramatically by the medication.

Prevents burns to esophagus that can lead to esophageal cancer and ongoing pain. None that I experienced. I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of GERG with an esophageal hernia over 7 years ago, and spent two years at physicians request trying a mix of different OTC drugs.   NO OTC drug worked to stop the burning and the coughing after meals caused by GERD. I tried most everything you'd find in the OTC shelf in a drug store.  Tums, Zantac, etc. etc. etc.   Finally, doctor ordered Prilosec for me, 1/day, 20mg, taken in am before eating.  At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter, still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since, daily.  If I don't take it, symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently, I have had to increase my dose ""occasionally"" to 1 pill also before dinner, but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.  I have never taken Nexium -- the HMO didn't cover it, but since Prilosec works so well, I don't feel the need to experiment.",high
lyrica,9,"lyrica neuropathy / anklosing spondylytis - Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug! The treatment side effects are somewhat severe.  The first dose I took almost immediately knocked me out!  I was so out of it, loopy, sleepy, etc. that all I could do is sit around and then go to sleep! It didn't get better after a couple of doses and I originally stopped taking it.  My doctor helped me build up a tolerance by stepping up the dosage over a week or so.  That limited the side effects but I still find that if I miss a dose by even a couple of hours, I start going through withdrawal and start feeling AWFUL!  I don't feel better until I get the dose!  That is somewhat scary to me and keeps me from trying a higher dose but the benefits of having a ""normal"" life outweigh the side effects and I dont' know of any safer options to do that. Treatment details?  I guess you are asking for how often, etc.?  I am on ongoing therapy.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  I try to keep my dosage schedule very precise because I pretty quickly show signs of withdrawal if I miss any.  It has allowed me to start physical therapy, which was previously unavailable because of the pain.

ritalin,8,"ritalin narcolepsy - No longer fell asleep at inappropriate and dangerous times. For the first time in my adult life I was able to concentrate. I was able to effectively work and study. Extreme fatigue when not taking ritalin such as on the weekend. Sometimes I was so fatigued, taking ritalin was unable to keep me awake. When I used ritalin during the day at work, it reduced my inhibitions in social and business situations and I would blurt out things before I had the chance to internally filter them. Experienced periods of sleeplesness at night. I would set the alarm for 6am, take ritalin, go back to sleep until 7am. This gave the ritalin time to kick in so I could feel awake when I arose.

methadone,10,"methadone opiate dependence - I have been able to maintain sobriety and get my life back on track.  Methadone has allowed me to get my ""bearings"" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task. WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth, and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well, especially my knees.  I can honestly say though, that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt, methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day, at least I am here to write about it. I had tried many times to get sober before beginning MMT.  I started methadone after 3 unsuccessful tries at in-patient and outpatient therapy.  When I first began treatment, I traveled 2 hours a day to received the dosage.  After about a year I was lucky enough to get in to a clinic closer to my home but by that time, I had completed all of the necessary counseling hours and had also received all clean swabs and urine tests and was given 3 day take homes.  Eventually that was extended to 6 days which is the most in my state or clinic that you are allowed. It has been about 7 years now, and I am in a total good place in life and feel that it's time to start tapering.  I have held the same job for almost 5 years, have a car, have my finances somewhat in order and am ready to move on to the next phase.  While I have had a relatively easy time of tapering, I had to stop for a couple of weeks because I started feeling some slight stomach cramping and body aches.  I made the decision to go down 2 mgs a week in hopes that such a small amount per week would allow my body to easily adjust to the change.  So far so good and I am hoping that by next summer I will be completely done.",high

She and I were both sensitive, angry, sad, and sometimes suicidal. I have just lived with it, not really taking meds much. I have to notice a difference in a few days if I am going to stick with something. My aunt told my sister that the people in our family do well on Paxil. My sister felt that it worked for her for a year or two, so I started taking it because it has reached a point where I have to be happy or die from stress. the Paxil had a noticeable effect on my anxiety levels in a matter of days, and an effect on my level of general happiness in a matter of a week or two. The doctor prescribed 20 mg which I just can't take because it makes me too sleepy the next day. I take 10mg which was enough for the first month. Now 10 mg is almost not enough, I can feel the anxiety there sometimes but more Paxil will make me sleepy. My 10 year old son inherited the family depression problem, he's been talking about killing himself and others. He started taking Paxil also, I have noticed a big difference. He is not angry so much anymore. It is helping us truly. I usually won't take prescriptions, I think they make people sicker sometimes.

It also moderately decreased Psoriatic Arthritis pains and also symptoms in nails and joints, but needed to be taken very regular for this.. Forgetting to take it twice a week already made it work less effective.

(Cabergoline was more effective, had less side effects- but potentially has side effects on heart valve, so one needs to be very careful with it. ) Some dyspepsia. This was all the side effects I noticed. I did not like these side effects though and therefore discontinued when the psoriatic arthritis  seemed to be under control. When I discontinued Parlodel, I  took Cabergoline( with a much longer half life in the body) in a very low dosage to make sure that my Prolactin levels only gradually moved back.
I know once I took Parlodel and stopped and then took a Prolactin test 48h later and the levels were higher then without taking any meds.
So best is to decrease dosage slowly and not suddenly. I think this is the case with any ergot derivative. Taken for 6 months. Once daily, but half a tablet of 2.5 mg was taken after a while to reduce side effects. I found the best way to get a stable prolactin levels and best improvement was to take half a tablet once in morning and once in evening.

The remainder of the dosage resulted in secureing my clarity and allowing my skin to look and feel better. Mild to moderate dryness on the lips and face. Mainly on either side of the face. I noticed very dry lips but peppermint beeswax lip balm seemed to fix the problem. Dryness seemed to be non existent with no blemishes but as soon as a cyst became visible it annhilated the surrounding area in dryness. After trying topical treatments, subscription products and tetracycline for many months, and with no decernable difference, my family doctor put me on a cycle of Accutane.

Not only was my back pain temporarily eliviated, I got uninterrupted sleep while I was taking this medication.  Before then, I hadn't slept for almost a week straight.  It was very important that I allowed at least eight hours of sleep.  I made the mistake a couple of times of taking it when I wasn't going to get a full nights sleep and ended up severely drowsy and unalert.  On those two occasions, I ""made-up"" for the missed hours of sleep and over slept.  This did not help, as it furthered my sleepiness.  I sort of had to get on a schedule again.

I took that in combination with the clonazepam prozac affects my sex drive mostly and i get headaches, the clonazepam i really don't feel any side effects except it doesn't always work and the seroquel puts on water weight gain makes you ravenous and can leave you feeling disoriented if you do not get enough sleep i am being treated for several disorders and will most likely remain on meds for life as i have recurrent depression and chronic insomnia.

This product as all prescription and nonprecriptions products that are available in the USA have offered no relief whatsoever from the flushing of Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin. This product immeidately caused my skin to turn bright red.  It stung and I had to wash it off.  I tried it a couple more days and then gave up, just as I have on all Rosacea medications.  Very very frustrating. My dermatologist doctor has yet to find something to help me.  I have also had laser treatments that are suppose to calm the skin but to no avail.

The most noticeable side effects, especially in the beginning of treatment, were mild dizziness and large pupils, making me sensitive to light, after waking up in the mornings.  That usually only lasts for 30-60 minutes.  
Side effects after taking for approximately 2 months:  Very vivid dreams when failing to take medication regularly.  Also, after approximately 2 months of treatment, the medication does not seem to be helping as much as in the beginning, as I am starting to wake up several times throughout the night again.

For years I had suffered with insomnia until my doctor prescribed Lunesta in a 3mg dose.  It worked very well putting me to sleep and I did not wake until morning.  Unfortunately I could sleep 10 - 12 hours and still wake up with a hangover from the medicine.  Sometimes a half of a pill would do but I would still have somewhat of a hangover although not as bad.  Now I only take during times of stress when sleeping is more important than any of the side effects.,high
naproxen,1,"naproxen joint pain - I didn't feel my joint pain after taking this, I think because I was too bothered by the side effects. I had the most intense stomach pain I've ever had in my life.

I needed to take the pills with lots of water, so I was always taking trips to the bathroom. I was on this pill for a long time, and I dont know if the constant ringing of my ears was a side effect, I did visit an ear doctor for this problem I thought was tinnitus but the doctor assured me the minocin had nothing to do with it. The ringing of the ears continued for about a year after I stopped taking minocycline. Occasionally I still get a ringing of the years, it can be sudden but lasts for a second or so...I was never diagnosed with tinnutus, but the ringing did lessen until it left after i stopped the pills. I was to take the pills twice a day with water. I took one in the morning after I ate, and one at night with plenty of water....after a year my body became resistant to the pill and stopped working, and i started taking higher doses without my doctors consent..which was wrong of me and dangerous and maybe that is why the ringing of my ears began...but I was obssessed with clearing up my acne.

He originally prescribed me Prozac many years ago, when I started seeing him after my husband left me abruptly alone with a three-year old son.  I felt like I was losing my mind.

catapres,7,"catapres sleep disruption due to hotflashes at night - I am sleeping more deeply, especially during the first four or five hours after falling asleep.  I still have hot flashes during those hours, however I seem to be in a deeper state of sleep and during those hours I usually don't fully awake during the hot flash, as I used to do.  I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle. There are no adverse side effects so far.  Some nights I don't sleep as deeply (as described above) during the first few hours of sleep.  I'm not sure what makes the difference from one night to the next-perhaps the amount of sleep I got in the few nights previous. I take one tablet at bedtime.  I try to delay taking it until I'm just about ready to go to sleep, since the effect is most pronounced in the first few hours after taking the tablet.  Later in the sleep cycle, my hot flashes wake me up more fully, as they have for the last four years.",high
flonase,10,"flonase nasal allergies - This drug reduced inflammation in the nasal passages, successfully treated hay-fever type symptoms, and also helped with hoarseness probably due to the fact that it cleared up post nasal drip.  I like to sing and I found I could sing longer without getting hoarse. I experienced no side effects, but I was careful not to use this drug continuously over a long period of time, just in case.  Generally I would start using it when symptoms were bad, stay on it for 2 to 3 weeks, then ease off. 2 sprays in each nostril once per day.  It takes about 36 hours to notice a beneficial effect.  Once my allergies were cleared up I could cut the dose in half and stay allergy free.",high

tramadol,4,"tramadol rib pain and muscle inflammation - I had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep. I took tramadol once, that's all it took for me to decide I didn't want to take it again.  I took it in the evening and went to sleep a few hours later, it made me very sleepy.  Upon waking up in the morning I felt extremely nauseous, shaky and - it's hard to explain, I felt inside my head a lot.  Very cloudy headed.  I thought I'd feel better if I took a shower but ended up throwing up b/c I just couldn't stand up, all I wanted to do was lie down.  I felt very dizzy. I laid down for about 10 mins and felt a little better, stomach was still upset though.  I ate something and immediately felt nauseous, was shaking uncontrollably and sweating.  I threw up again.  The episodes continued through most of the day.  But I felt better as time went on.  I decided the side effects just aren't worth it! Overall Tramadol just isn't work the side effects I experienced.

ortho-novum,7,"ortho-novum birth control - The prevention of pregnancy was the benefit in addition to almost completely eliminating a monthly menstrual cycle.  Other than that, there were no other benefits involved in taking this medication.  The benefits at the time that I was taking this drug outweighed the risks. However, at this time, the risks and side effects now outweigh the benefits. After going off of the birth control pill, I noticed an elevation of mood.  When I began taking the pill after being off of it for a while, I noticed the difference in my mood.  My mood is much more consistently positive when not on the drug.  In addition, now that I am older, I have no desire to take this medication as the potential side effects/risks are too high for women who are 30+. The risks that most concern me are risk of blood clots and stroke even though I have never been a smoker. I took the birth control pill for approximately 10 years fairly consistently. There were periods of time during those 10 years when I did not take the drug.  I am no longer taking the birth control pill and do not currently see this as a viable option for me given my age and potential side effects.",high

adipex-p,5,"adipex-p weight loss - They gave me a little more energy for the first week or two.  But then after that, no noticable increased energy was felt.  The first 3 days my hunger seemed to be less, but I think this was only due to a plecebo affect. None that I could notice.  Then did not give me insomnia. I was about 50 lbs overweight.  I was eating all the time, but mostly after about 9:00pm.  And I was always craving sweets.  I tried to get myself to the gym, but I was too tired all the time.  I tried other appetite suppresents, like hoodia, but nothing seemed to work.  The I finally talked the doctor in to prescribing me phentermine.  She was reluctant because I have high  blood pressure and I take medicine for that.  But I took my blood pressure everyday for the 3 months and I had NO increase in pressure as long as I took my medicine.  Unfortunately, after the three months, I had only lost 5 lbs. which, I always seemed to fluctuate anyway.  So to recap, phentermine did absolutely nothing for me.",high
xanax,10,"xanax anxiety - Xanax took the edge off of the anxiety without causing drowsiness or interfering with thought process. The anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of 5 years prior. Calendar dates were going to be of importance. There were none whatsoever except the anxiety returned when the drug wore off and when I was anxious my memory recall was negatively affected. Xanax was prescribed for me because I was a plaintiff in litigation and my accurate testimony was imperative, especially memory recall of specific dates 5 years prior to my testimony. The defense attorney was a rude and nasty old man and was deliberately trying to confuse me to the point of tears. My attorney had warned me beforehand about the defense attorney's tactics so I asked my doctor for a short term tranquilizer. During recesses in my testimony (2 days) I would take a Xanax to keep me focused. It worked like a charm and I won the case. It just seemed to keep me sharp, rather than sedated.",high

I was directed to apply the cream every evening before bed for 5 nights in a row then allow a ""rest"" period for 2 days. After about 1 1/2 weeks I started getting blisters that eventually started itching and seeping.  I called my derm and was told to wait for about a week and then to reapply the cream.  I did as instructed and all the abnormal skin cells were gone but I was left with small pink colored scars all over my chest.  I have worked for about 2 years applying many different things to even my skin tone back up with only limited success.

flonase,9,flonase sinus congestion / allergies - My dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated. some light nasal bleeding and a dry mouth when not taken precisely as directed.  It's important not to let the medication go too far into the nasal passage so that it doesn't go down the back of the throat which will lead to dry mouth.

nardil,9,"nardil depression (atypical) - A dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  There were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  Also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  In addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically. The most troublesome side effect was faintness upon rising quickly from a seated (or horizontal) position.  On one occasion I lost consciousness and fell.  However, this side effect went away after three months or so.  There was also some decrease in sexual desire, but this side effect also lessened over time.  A side effect that seems to be permanent is lower blood pressure, but this is actually a benefit for most people.  I've been told that some people take MAOI's solely to decrease their blood pressure. It takes some time to build up to a clinical dosage.  As I recall, my doctor had me take 15mg for a weak, 30mg for two weeks, 45mg for two weeks until I had built up to 75mg.  I did not begin to feel the antidepressant effect until I reached 45mg. When I reached 60mg the antidepressant effect had kicked in fully and I even experienced a period (two or three weeks) of a mild euphoria, which I have been told is fairly typical.  My doctor thought that a slow buildup of the drug in my system was the most effective treatment.  He also had me taking Lamictal (150mg per day), which he thought might spark a stronger reaction to Nardil.  There are also some diet restrictions: no aged cheeses and no aged meats.  Also, some cold medications must be avoided.",high

zoloft,7,"zoloft traumatic brain injury - Zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my ""why me"" or ""I suck"" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same. There was a definite decrease in sexual desire and performance, but it is hard to say if the zoloft is to be blamed for everything. I was put on zoloft while still in the hospital having suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. I was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me, and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft, because i knew i was going to be depressed. I continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. When I stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) I went on living ok, but was still depressed. I was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery, so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use, but I eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. There is something to be said for a natural high, but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus.",high

lamotrigine,1,"lamotrigine migraines - None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects! Within hours of taking the first dose I had vaginal itching.  Since I read that was a side effect in the paperwork, I didn't think much of it.  After two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  I thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  The medication was taken at bedtime.  When I woke up after taking the third dose, I had blisters on the outer labia.  Late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, I was in severe pain.  The blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  During the drive, I felt so bad I was praying for my life so I could continue to raise my children, even though I do not believe in god!  It is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  My blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and I have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  I have not taken my temperature but I'm sure I have one.  I feel like I have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  I'm no doctor, but I highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use IMMEDIATELY upon ANY gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.  The goose eggs in my bikini area continue to grow and become more tender. My neurologist that prescribed the med told me to see my primary gyn if symptoms are not gone a week after discontinuation.

prozac,5,"prozac mild depression and anxiety - So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring. Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this, I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began, I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.  No sexual side effects noted yet. I was prescribed Prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began, I went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  The psychiatrist had said some people react to Prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  I also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in Prozac users.  I go back to MY Psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill, the side effects I'm experiencing, and whether or not we should continue.",high

My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately, it did not. There were no side effects to the treatment except that it worsened my breakouts.  However, it did nothing to take down the flares even after three months of treatment.  Soon after I stopped using it, my skin improved.  So now, I choose to use an exfoliation product and a separate over the counter acne treatment product. differin did not help prevent acne or get rid of current acne.  it worsened the condition though it was explained that as it helped the skin exfoliate, the impurities beneath the outer skin surfaced.  however, there were no improvements after three months of application.",Low

neurontin,1,"neurontin migraines - My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines) I was a zombie. Some aspects of this subsided over the first year, however others did not. My vocabulary suffered horribly and never really recovered. I went from being a very well spoken person to someone struggling to grasp some words over three letters. Coworkers even mentioned to me that they noticed this effect. My memory suffered horribly as well. I would have to cut back on my dosage during exam times (I was in school as well as working at the time). There seemed to be absolutely no way for me to memorized the volume of work I needed to while on this drug.

The sleepiness I experienced was awful. This diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years I took it. A couple of times I had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. The sleepiness was overwhelming at times. I once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. While on Neurontin I also had an annoying tendency to forget what I was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. Since abandoning Neurontin and switching to Lamictal I no longer have this problem. Used as a migraine prophylactic, my Dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what I believe was 300mg. per day up to 2400 over approximately two months. I was to take the medicine throughout the day but I sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself. Unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times I told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside.

detrol-la,8,"detrol-la bladder pressure - For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night. I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also, your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable. I was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication.",high
wellbutrin,10,"wellbutrin smoking cessation - The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money. The most obvious side effect for me was difficulty sleeping.  
Hard to take but I knew that it would be temporary and I knew that I would rather have spotty sleep for as much as a few weeks in trade for not smoking ever again.
The difficulty sleeping didn't last long into the treatment, though.  A week maybe.  
I remember reading about other side effects like a dry mouth, but the most alarming one is possible seizures.  Talk to your doctor. Treatment details are above (oops).  
Once a day for three days and twice a day (twelve hours apart) for up to three months after that.
At day ten the patient should stop smoking cold turkey.",high

azor,8,"azor anxiety attacks - Can get a good nights rest and anxiety attacks are supressed. I have been able to lead a normal life and be successfull. I am doing my doctoral now in medical research and belief without Azor it would not be possible. I remember what my life was before Azor and am relieved to know it is behind me. I have been on it for years now, the benefits outweighs the disadvantages- I know Im addicted. Azor was and still is prescribed to me by my psychiatrist. Some lethargic tendencies and drowsiness at times when taken for anxiety attack. Also, I am addicted to it. I can not sleep witout Azor. I take one tablet (0.5g) Azor whenever I have a anxiety attack or struggle to sleep. 
I was attacked a few years back, and still have panic attacks on occasion and struggle to sleep considerably. In addition, I have nightmares. However, when I take the azor, I calm down. Furthermore,I did try sleeping medication, however,I was always tired and struggled to wake up. When I take azor, I can sleep without the whooziness the following morning.",high
xanax,8,"xanax anxiety/depression - I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck. lethargy, loss of appetite. I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.",high

I was warned about blood pressure, kidney, and liver problems, I was told to look out for the shakes and a general feeling of being ""on speed"".  I admit the only side effects I felt was a slight case of feeling light headed, I found I had a lot more energy.

There have been no side effects to my knowledge.  I do realize that if I do not take the medicine as indicated that I get tired more frequently and feel slugish.

topamax,5,"topamax sedative/hypnotic - to induce sleep - topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the Elavil I was taking as sleep med.  Elavil and Effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  I was taking 300mg Elavil each night.

mobic,2,"mobic jaw/tooth pain - I did not feel that the original diagnosis was correct. I went to the doctor for tooth pain and he chose to treat me for TMJ of which I disagreed. As it turned out the diagnosis was incorrect as I eventually had the tooth pulled and all pain stopped. I did not complete the suggested treatment plan due to mild side effects listed below. The most uncomfortable was tingling in my arms and legs. Otherwise it was the general feeling that foreign drugs were in my body as I do not usually take any kind of drugs. The treatment being described as above. I consider it to be a mis-diagnosis and was quite disappointed that a Medical M.D. who not consider that I knew my own body well enough to know what was really wrong. Hence, I was diagnosised and prescribed incorrectly. Knowing this I did not follow through on the treatment plan. The only reason I decided to take the meds in the first place was because a nurse friend of mine also convinced me I should take the meds. They were both wrong.",Low

Prostate appeared normal, but physician said I could have swelling on side or prostate he cannot feel. He prescribed tamsulosin. It did the job!

This is a low dose tetracycline antibiotic, so you should avoid the sunlight and tanning beds while taking it.  It's typical side effects are the same as any antibiotic. I took the prescribed dose for 6 months(even though my dermatologist said I could stay on it indefinitely). The rash disappeared within 1-2 weeks.I was very pleased with the medication.

copaxone,9,"copaxone relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis - It reduces the frequency of episodes of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis. The most common side effects are reactions at the injection site, which I have had, especially at the beginning of treatment. These are redness, a lump or firmness, soreness, or itching at the site of injection. Once I developed a permanent depression at an injection site, which is caused by a localized destruction of fat tissue. Some patients (I never have) develop a short term reaction experienced immediately after injecting this medicine. This reaction  includes a feeling of warmth and/or redness known as flushing, chest tightness or pain with heart palpatations, anxiety, and trouble breathing. These symptoms may last a few minutes then go away by themselves without any further problems. Each package of Copaxone contains a complete list of possible side effects, or you may obtain this list from your doctor or pharmacist. Each single use blister pack of Copaxone contains one prefilled syringe containing 20 mg of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) which the patient self administers subcutaneously, in the fatty layer of skin, once a day. It is important to rotate injection sites daily.",high
synthroid,10,"synthroid hashimotos disease - Once I was diagnosed properly and began taking the synthroid, my dry skin cleared up, my energy level increased and my depression lifted.  My hair is now thick and shiny again.  I did not have weight gain so I cannot comment on that. I did not experience any side effects.  My doctor is very hesitant to give me the generic version as there are many cmplaints that the generic version does not relive symptoms. I take one pill every morning with a very large glass of water.  I must wait one hour before eating or drinking anything but water.  I take this pill at the same time every morning and it took about 2 to 3 weeks to begin feeling better.  I must get regular, every 3months, bloodwork to check thyroid levels.",high
prilosec,8,"prilosec nausea after eating - I was able to eat without nausea and vomiting after meals.  I was able to regain lost weight.  I was able to eat normal sized meals again. I had no side effect with the treatment.  The only drawback was the need to eat within 30 minutes of taking the medication.  There were times when an unavoidable delay in the mealtime made it necessary to eat something else in the interim. I didn't have usual GERD symptoms of heart burn.  I was skeptical that my stomach was producing too much acid.  I tried other home remedies like drinking diluted apple cider after a meal that seemed to work at times but didn't always.  After my doctor prescribed prilosec, it took several weeks before relief was complete.  I am still taking the medication but have scaled back to 20 mg just once a day.",high

claritin,7,"claritin allergies - well controlled seasonal allergies and improved breathing.  I was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing, especially while working out, also improved.  Years later I was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  I had noticed I had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until I started taking the Claritin.  Then running became much easier, so it now makes sense to me that the Claritin helped so much. none that I recall - was before claritin became OTC.  I really liked taking the claritin because I had no side effects, unlike some other allergy medicines I had taken earlier, and unlike some OTC I had tried earlier.  When taking the Claritin I felt that I was not really taking anything.  It was just easier to go about my daily routine and enjoy sports a lot more. I have really appreciated how Claritin has helped me. The treatment details were very simple as far I can remember.  One pill once a day.  I stayed on the Claritin for at least three years.  I do not recall any side effects or problems during this time.  Eventually it seemed as if I didn't have any allergies because I had gotten so used to the positive effects of taking this medication.",high
lyrica,8,"lyrica fibromyalgia and myofacial pain - Nerve pain and muscle pain decreased significantly within the first couple days.  Fibromyalgia was very debilitating for me but with Lyrica, I was able to go back to work and function normally.  It helped with pins and needles, twitching, and muscle spasms.  It also seemed to help with some of the anxiety I experienced. Constipation mainly.  I didn't gain or lose weight.  A little dry eyes and mouth.  I did have several colds the second year so it may have lowered my immunity.  These side affects was worth the benefits for me I was first given 75 mg once a day and realized the medicine didn't last 24 hours so I started on twice daily doses and that helped.  I needed a little more pain reliever and started Tramadol along with the Lyrica.  I would take extra Tramadol if necessary, which provided relief at times when pain spiked.",high

Two capsules per day did the trick. Am able to sleep through the night the majority of the time!",high
lexapro,7,"lexapro anxiety - The benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  It took almost two months for the benefits to kick in, but when they did it was well worth it.  The depression also decreased significantly.  I'm not sure if that was due to the addition of Wellbutrin, or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression. There were several side effects worth noting.  First of all, the Lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  Taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect, as did the addition of Wellbutrin.  Weight gain also occurred, as well as a severe decrease in libido.  When weaning off of the Lexapro, severe dizziness occurred. 10 mg of Lexapro (daily) was prescribed.  It was taken every day for nearly two years, in conjunction with check-ups with the prescribing psychiatrist every six months.  (The psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situational.  Therefore, regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  After two years on the medication, treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  During the weening process, severe dizziness occurred.  The only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a Lexapro pill.  As the weening continued, dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  Eventually, the dizziness ceased completely.",high
tamiflu,10,"tamiflu flu symptoms - Strength returning, clarity, ability to breath improved It took two days before any of the symptoms got better The doctor only prescribed the exact dosage and days.  One tablet every day for 5 days.  I was disheartened that my health insurance only paid 10 - 15% of the cost of the medication because it was a very expensive mediaction.

However, it did come back after i stopped taking it, which meant it was somewhat useless. I had diahrea and some stomach upsets....While i wasn't taking it for my acne, it seemed to have helped it. However, the Diahrea is something i've had with most antibiotics. I countered it by having acidophilus supplements, which worked really well. None i can describe, just took two tablets a day. One before breakfast and one before dinner. The treatment lasted ten days and i took it religiously. I did have to take other acidophilus containing products to control the side effects but it was fortunate that it lasted only 10 days.",high
synthroid,8,synthroid hypothyroid deficiency - The treatment remedied her lab values as well as treated her symptoms of weight gain and lack of energy. Patient occasionally feels a bit shakey. Patient was treated for low thyroid test results which coincided with the onset of menopause which manifested itself in a weight gain of 20# and a marked lack of energy.

Weight gain, loss of interest in creative activities, loss of interest in sex, loss of interest in work, inability to work, inability to feel or think or behave beyond the very basic requirements of living. Overall the drug is zombifying and has made me numb. Inability to work has lead to the worst side effect of all... poverty on the pension for me and my children.

It also slowed down heavy menstraul bleeding somewhat that was caused by the size, number and location of my uterine fibriods. Sleepiness and increased fatigue during the day. I took approximately 50 mg. of Motrin 2 to 4 times daily during the heaviest days of my mentrsual flow.",high
flexeril,9,"flexeril muscle spasm - A muscle in my neck was pinching a nerve such that  if i turned my head or lay on that side my arm would instantly start to tingle and my hand fall asleep.  The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely. I do not feel that I experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the Flexeril.  If I was tired, the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy, and if I took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. But, to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do. I was prescribed Flexeril (10mg) for a muscle spasm in my neck that was pinching a nerve to my right arm.  I took the ten miligrams of Flexeril three times a day for about a month as needed as it was prescribed. Then, as the symptoms lessened to the point where they only bothered me on and off, I took the ten miligrams only once or twice a day depending on how my neck felt for about another month, and finally, during the next month, I only took it when I started to feel like the symptoms might be coming back, which was maybe once or twice a week.  Since then, I have not experienced any symptoms, and it has been over a year.",high
xanax,6,"xanax anxiety - When I am in highly stressful situations, I start to cry.  I took xanax at times when I knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  I did not cry at all, my eyes didn't even water.  This has never happened with any other medication. While the drug did give the desired effect, I was groggy and tired.  The worst side effect would be that I had short-term memory loss during when I took it.  I would see notes that I took at the time and not remember writing them and had trouble remembering the details of conversations I had at the time. Dr. suggested I take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when I did that, I still cried during the stressful situations.",high
doxycycline,10,"doxycycline severe peridontal disease - I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish. None. A dentist in my dental HMO prescribed it and was willing to continue to do so because I implored him to do so.",high

pamelor,7,"pamelor depression - This medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs I have tried.  Also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, 9-12 months) which I experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  The facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain. One of the most unfortunate side effects of all tricyclic antidepressants for many people is weight gain.  I was 'lucky' that I did not gain weight, but I was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

The medication also increased my heart rate.  I was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  Taking it in the AM seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night). I began at 10mg then worked up to a 50mg dose.  I had relatively good suppression of depressive symptoms at all doses, higher doses being better.  The higher doses did not seem to increase the weight gain/heart rate side effects any more than the lower doses (as in non-dose-dependent effects).",high
wellbutrin-xl,9,"wellbutrin-xl depression/dysthymia - Wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. I have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). Wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects. Side effects included mild nausea and shakiness. These side effects disappeared after about two weeks. I have been on Wellbutrin for four years and will probably continue use for several more years.",high
seasonique,2,"seasonique heavy periods/cramping - Prevented pregnancy Breakthrough bleeding, headaches, extreme breast tenderness, breakouts. I was very skeptical about taking Seasonique, because some friends of mine had taken it in the past and did not have good experiences. However, I had always experienced heavy periods and cramping, even after trying 3 different birth controls so I decided to give it a try. My doctor assured me that Seasonique was safe and I shouldn't have any severe side effects. After only a couple weeks, I started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I started experiencing more side effects. I have been blessed with great skin, only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. However, after being on Seasonique for about a month, I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. I didn't want to stop taking birth control, so I figured I would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. About a month and a half into taking Seasonique, I began to breakthrough bleed. I had a full blown period for exactly 3 weeks. I consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. While on Seasonique, I could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend Seasonique to anyone.",Low

Take Ambien in various dosages (up and down) for primary long-standing (over 25 years) insomnia.  Have tried various drugs over the years. Better results compared with temazepam, lunesta, melatonin, lorazepam, trazadone, but stimulates appetite and ingestion of (yes, I started counting!) 300-400 extra calories at bedtime and shortly thereafter.

Before the lortab i did try the flexeril first and it didn't help, then I tried it with the Lyrica that only dulled the pain a little. Then the lortab and it helped tremendously. I started on two times a day after a month went to three and it helped to the point where i could work and I could get out of bed and do things like cut the grass or hiking and just many of other things. My overall experience were tremendous with minimal side effects!!!!! The Side effects I experienced were minimal such as dizzyness, or lightheaded but addding a little food before my dose would most of time cure the side effects. I was diagnosed with a disc problem that was pinching my nerves in low back. My Sciatica was being pinched by the disc causing my leg to hurt really bad and numbness and tingling were involved. I started taking flexeril first and it by itself wasn't helping. Then i was put on lyrica 2 times daily with the flexerill and it dulled the pain but not much. After that i really didn't want nothing that strong but the pain was severe so the doc put me on lortab 2 times daily to start with and 3 times daily the next month and that helped tremendously.

I experienced very noticeable hair loss when washing my hair.  It seemed to go away after about 2 weeks, but this could also be when I lowered my daily total dose from 1200mg to 800mg.
When I again started taking 1200mg total per day, my hair loss seems to have returned. I was prescribed acyclovir for an initial diagnosis of HSV 2.

My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles. I used the cream each night. The texture was thick and the smell was not appealing. A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The peeling was annoying as I would constantly have to put moisturizer on to stick the skin back down. After a month of dilligent nightly usage I did not notice a lightening of my dark spots nor any reduction in my wrinkles.  Perhaps with continued use my spots would have lightened but honestly, I couldn't stand walking around with skin peels hanging off my face. The Dr should have advised me about the peeling.

This med allowed me to function again within my family and within the working world.  I stopped crying all the time and was able to concentrate and perform the tasks necessary for employment.  I got my life back. Unlike other antidepressants with numerous side effects, this med had no internal side effects.  The only complaint I had with this med was the skin irritation at the application site.  This I treated with moisturizers and hydrocortisone creams. I simply applied one patch daily to any part of the ""trunk"" area of my body.  It was not a drug I had to be introduced to slowly or weaned off of.

keflex,10,"keflex post operative antibiotic - Prevention of post surgical infection and peace of mind following my minor outpatient surgery. The mild side effects I experienced included fatigue and the abdominal bloating and intestinal tract upset that commonly accompanies any antibiotic treatment.  It would be helpful if the Patient Education information sheet included commentary about this phenomenon and instructions regarding using yogurt or supplements to prevent digestive difficulties. The Patient Education information sheet mentioned hives and rash as potential side effects when taking this medication.  As a person who is allergic to dyes and food colorings, (a red, itching, burning, eczema like rash results when I ingest these additives) I find it unnecessary that the gel cap in which this medication is contained would have to be colored green or colored at all for that matter.  In order to avoid this unpleasant side effect, I opened each gel cap just prior to taking it, poured the medication out onto a spoon and swallowed it down as quickly as possible.

After PT which only mildly helped I asked for various meds. Vicodin helped some but left me hung over. Valium released the muscle seizures and allowed me slowly to   return to exercise. It's not used much now that there's Flexeril, but F. can lead to depression and doesn't as effectively release muscle tension (in my case). some sluggishness in the early morning, and sometimes an overall sense of dehydration, but that can be countered with drinking lots of fluids.

celexa,5,"celexa depression - For the depression it didn't make much of a difference; but it worked wonders for my anxiety. The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion. COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment. I started with 10mg/day, for one month, when I started to feel less anxious, but not motivated or more energetic, as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months, when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed, the dose went up to 30 mg/day, it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week, then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely.

Also, I developed other side effects while using the drug, including low-level nausea, loss of appetite and headaches. I started off on a dose of 1 x 500 mg enteric-coated tabs four times daily (the doctor's recommended test dose to see if I responded negatively to the drug), but when I tried to increase this to 2x 500 mg tabs four times daily after one week, the side effects I had been experiencing increased, so I dropped back. I tried one more time to increase the dose more gradually (2 x 500 mg in the morning; then 1 x 500 mg at lunch, dinner and bedtime), but even this became too unpleasant to put up with (especially since I didn't have these symptoms before I started!). I perservered for 6 weeks, before deciding to taper the dose to zero over a couple of weeks, after which the symptoms disappeared.",Low

chantix,10,"chantix to help quit smoking cigarettes - I was able to quit smoking 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I had smoked 2 1/2 packs of menthols for 35 years.  No one,including me, thought I could ever quit.  The Chantix kept me from feeling any withdrawal from nicotine and made it so smoking didn't give me the ""boost"" it had.  There became no point in smoking.  I kept the last prescription to take ""PRN' when in certain situations.  It also took a little mental work. Only one I noticed was waking up feeling like I'd had bad dreams.  I didn't realize it was a side effect until reading about it later.  A few bad dreams was well worth the results. You take 1/2 dose pills for maybe a week in the starter pack.  Then move to full strength.  Take 1 in the morning and one in the evening or late day.  Try to establish a ""quit"" day before starting.  I didn't.  I used it for 2-3 weeks while I tapered down and worked on the psychological aspects.  After 2 days of only having 1 cig a day, I stopped.  After 4 months, my insurance no longer paid.  I needed longer and paid full price.  I used my last box PRN.  When I'd be in an evening situation where I thought it might be difficult, I'd take one a few hours before going and it would work.

I had found with other treatment options, such as the insulin pump and the nph insulins that my morning blood sugars were always high, even with increased dosages. The only side effects were increased weight gain and increased hypoglycemia in the late evenings/early mornings.  The side effect is because Lantus has a 22 hour duration after injection and as a result whenever I experience a greater than usual amount of activity, my insulin sensitivity increases dramatically. Treatment consisted of a morning and evening dose of lantus split up as 30 units in the evening and 15 units in the morning.  It took approximately two years of playing with the dosage amounts to find this as the ""best fit"" as all dosages either resulted in extremely low evening blood sugars or extremely high morning blood sugars.

If I take 50 mg at night, I get up to pee once, sometimes twice, during the night.  

25 mg twice per day seems like the worst of both worlds -- tired during the day and up to pee at night. 

Next experiment -- taking 50 mg with lunch and increasing water intake -- maybe I can be energetic in the morning at least!",high
claritin,5,"claritin alergy - The medication did provide some lessening of allergy symptoms.  It helped my nose not to water as much.  However, I still had congestion and some days where my allergies were quite uncomfortable.  It seemed the effects lessened as time went on so the medication was less effective than at the beginning. Also my eyes still itched.  My throat also itched. I suffered from a dry throat, sore throat, and stuffy nose.  My nose seemed to get too dry.  But it still felt congested.  It just didn't run as much.  Also, my bronchial tubes had a hard time dilating at times and I wheezed.  It did not lessen my asthma symptoms even though I didn't have bouts of asthma on a regular basis. I don't think I had any other side effects. I took the pills every morning and night, about twelve hours apart between doses.  the medication did not keep me awake or make me jittery. The medication also did not make me drowsy like some other allergy medications.  The medication, however, did not always relieve my symptoms.  I ultimately tried another medication to see if I could get better results.  I also had to use an inhaler for wheezing since the medication did not help that symptom.",high

coumadin,5,coumadin blood clots - prevent further clots and to dissolve pulmonary embolism blood clotting times would vary tremendously and required frequent testing to determine dosage adjustments.  Sometimes clotting times would need to be checked weekly or more often. The diet was very restrictive.  Too much vitamin K could lead to clots and too little could lead to spontaneous bleeding.

She was also on a lot of other medications and I think the combination of medicines put her into heart attack and she passed away.

Although the peeling wasn't as bad as with regular Retin-A, the redness and flaking skin affected my appearance.

Applied at night, after cleansing the face, more than thirty minutes before going to bed.  Used ~1 cm of the cream for entire face and neck, followed with 4% Hydroquinone solution.  When swelling occurred, application was omitted until it disappears, which usually took place in 24 hours.",high
desyrel,1,"desyrel insomnia - I did sleep reliably and without waking up in the middle of the night gradually got more and more sedated during the day.  I functioned as though my IQ had dropped about 30 points.  It kinda dumbed me down until I was screwing up at work--forgetting details, working slowly, not able to focus, etc.  Also, I became very unassertive--not like me at all. When I realized what was happening, I went off it--and had a significant withdrawal reaction--shaking, extremely anxious, really weird.  The withdrawal reaction subsided in a couple of days. I was prescribed this drug for insomnia.  My MD told me that it had been used as an anti-depressant, but didn't work well for that, but was good for insomnia.  She originally prescribed 25 mg, and suggested I work up from that if 25 was ineffective.  I am very drug sensitive, so when 25 mg. really knocked me out and I could barely wake up the next day, I cut the pills in half, and that seemed to work--but I just gradually got the effects mentioned above.  I realized later that I had taken the same drug, higher dose, under the name Desyrel when I was 43 for post partum depression.  It didn't work, and it made my blood pressure go down--the number I remember is 77/44.  Same reaction--very sedated, confused, etc.  I would never have taken it, but it was not identified as Desyrel, even on the pharmacy information sheet, so I didn't realize what it was.  The weird thing about this drug (for me) is that it makes me so confused, but subtly, that I can't think clearly enough to realize what is happening until it gets pretty bad.  I know I am very sensitive, and this may be a completely idiosyncratic reaction, but I don't think so.  When I talked to the pharmacist about it she said ""Yeah, some people just can't take it.""  I know people who take 300 mg a night--and they are fine!.",Low

There was no noticeable improvement in mood which was a disappointment. He had fairly severe nausea, diarrhea and cramps almost immediately after switching to the higher does of Aricept. The side effects were so severe, the medication had to be discontinued. He started out with the introductory dose (5 mg) and then graduated to the full dose (10 mg). When the side effects became a problem, he was put back down to the introductory dose, but the side effects continued, and we saw no real benefits from the drug.

My heart rate decreased and I felt slightly less anxious but I still had a feeling of unease especially during social situations. Social situations felt only barely tolerable.  Though symptoms were minimized slightly it wasn't worth the side effects. The symptoms I had were one of feeling spacey, dizzy and slightly nauseous and I couldn't take these at work where I felt the most anxiety. These symptoms seemed to last what felt like quite a while at least 2 to 3 hours after taking them but in all honesty most anti anxiety and depression meds have little positive effect. Treatment consisted of seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and all though the psychologist was marginally helpful I eventually turned to meditation and found a lot more relief than through medication and talk therapy.The psychiatrist tried to help me changing dosage and medication every couple of months but I never felt much relief.",Low
tramadol,1,"tramadol osteochondral injury of the talus, left ankle - I had no benefits from this medication, if anything it added more problems for me. It never once relieved my pain in my ankle. Darvacet helped my ankle more then this medication.

My whole body ached I had severe stomachaches and headaches. I turned into a zombie all I did was stare at the wall. It would make me dizzy and at times I wouldn't know where I was at. I was scared to be on it, but I wasn't in my right mind to be able to take myself off of it. I took a blade one night and slashed both my arms up and hid the fact that I did it. I started to take myself off the medication. When I was able to think straight I admitted to people I know what I had done to my arms. Other then my ankle pain I felt 100% better off of Tramadol. I believe that if I were to stay on Tramadol I would have done something much worse. Since being off of this medication I realize how that person then wasn't me. That scared me more then anything ever. Doctor's need to monitor patients much more closely on Tramadol. I can't imagine that there are a lot of people with my reaction to it but I can't imagine even one other person having an adverse reaction like I did. I had an ankle accident at a job. I had this injury for a long time.There isn't much that can be done for it. So I will be on pain medication for the rest of my life. I had taken Darvacet for about 6 years before it lost its effectiveness. Tramadol was only the second pain medication I had ever tried. My doctor thought it would help me. I had never heard about it before. I never once thought I would have such a bad reaction to it. After taking almost 8 Darvacet a day I was ready to try anything else. I just wish for people to be very careful with Tramadol I don't want anyone else going through what I did.",Low

Even though I took Mobic as directed with food and/or milk, it made me extremely nauseous, which was more debilitating to me than the whiplash pain I was experiencing.  I stopped taking it after 1 week and was immediately no longer experiencing nausea.

seasonique,4,"seasonique migraine + birth control - I had been on Quasense (a generic for a different type of extended BC) and liked it a lot but I noticed when I would go off the pill (for period) I would get extreme migraines when my hormones fluctuated.  Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant. I experienced a number of side effects without even connecting it to the pill.  Once I read about all the side effects online it was an ""ah ha"" moment.  Weight gain --I am a runner and eat well and I have gained 10 pounds in six months.  I workout 5-6 times a week and didn't change my diet and couldn't figure it out.

vicoprofen,7,"vicoprofen oral infection - The benefits to the treatment was temporary relief of pain due to unknown infection in jaw area. Though no other drugs were taken to address the infection, the prescribed drug did alleviated the pain until the condition improved. Eventually a root canal was performed and I received a second prescription. The only noticeable side effect was that I became drowsy when taking the drug and  had to lay down throughout the day.  As I was unable to work under these conditions,  I did not have to perform usual task, therefore it is hard to measure what I would or would not have been able to do while taking the pain killer. I went to my dentist complaining of immense pain and swelling in my jaw area.  An x-ray was performed and nothing could be detected.  However, due to my symptoms, Hydrocodone/Ibuprofen was prescribed.  I was sent home with a follow up visit  scheduled.  The swelling and pain decreased within a few days, I discontinued taking the drug and I was able to continue normal activities.  However, approximately a week later the symptoms returns and I returned to dentist.  This time the x-ray revealed a need for a root canal.

lortab,8,"lortab oral surgery - As having surgery, my mounth experienced excruiating pain. I was without them for 3 hours. These seemed like the worst day of my life. After taking the pills I noticed one of two things occured. One, the pain was gone soon after taking them. Two, I became extremely tired. First I thought that it was only like this because I just had surgery, but no. It seemed as though everytime I taken a pill I needed a nap soon after. Don't get me wrong, I would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. This stayed this way for the entire time that I was on Lortab. Major drowsiness. Every time a took the pills, it made me extremely sleepy. This made me unable to drive, do heavy activies, or even hold a conversation. Also, if I taken the pill when I have had nothing to eat for a while, it seem to make me sick for a short period of time, roughly 30 mintues up to a hour and a half. I never became dizzy or anything else. The pill did wonders for the pain. When I took them I recieved results within 10-20mins. They also lasted a moderate amount of time to deal with the pain as well. They do become somewhat ""addicting"". So I tried to take 1000 - 1200mg of Ibuprofen to compensate for the Lortab. However, when your in a lot of pain, Ibuprofen just doesnt to seem to deliever the results that Lortab could provide.",high

After I stopped taking the Lipitor, most of the pain stopped.  The muscle pain is gone, but some of the joint pain has continued. The doctor perscribed the Lipitor for my high cholesterol.

They told me to quit taking it and put me on Cefadroxil (generic for Duricef) instead.  I tolerated that fine.  Levaquin is a very expensive antibiotic and now I'm stuck with the cost of that.

It has helped control my blood sugar very well. It can sometimes cause nausea. At the start of treatment it was bad but now it only happens if I miss a dose then the next one will cause nausea.  The first couple of months I saw a very slight drop in weight but I am not sure if the Byetta caused this. I take a shot before my first meal and last meal each day.

I also experienced a lower libido than normal. I also experienced a lower level of energy throught the day. the side effects were not extreme and did go away after discontinuing the treatment. The treatment details were the oral intake of finasteride. I obtained it in the 5mg form known as proscar. I would cut the tablet in half to get a 2.5mg dosage. I took 2.5mg of finasteride every day at night before i went to sleep. If i missed a dosage i waited for the next day to take the next dosage.

This drug worked as expected and the results were remarkable. I did not experience any adverse side effects from the zithromax.  I was experiencing fatigue, nausia, sleeping problems and other typical flu or cold symptoms, but I think that was mostly due to the infections not the zithromax.

I originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage, depending on how ""excitable"" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone. I have had none of the side effects listed except for the ""may cause drowziness"" which is the whole reason I am taking trazadone.

I am not sure how long it will last, but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years, and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination, I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake, I am hurting, but within 20 minutes of taking meds, I am my old, 25 year old self again. I have experienced NO side effects other than feeling high, a little off-balance, and sleepy. I actually take the Valium at work and have had NO problems whatsoever, I am very happy with my doctors prescribed meds, and hope Valium continues to work for me in the same manner it has so far.

Follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked. The doctor has recommended that I stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective. The side effects of Diovan were so minimal I cannot detect them; however, I cannot take the Diovan HCT because it messes up my eletrolytes and I get leg and foot cramps. I try to follow dosage instructions which recommends that this pill be taken at night before going to bed, if possible. The treatment with Diovan is very simple. One pill at night before going to bed.The reason for that is most people's blood pressure increases at night and many people die in their sleep at night because of high blood pressure. The problem I have is that the pills get stuck in my throat and I have to eat something like a grape or anything really that will help the pill go down.It does not seem to keep me awake at night which is good.",high

I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60, wigs are definitely in order. Also, I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased. No major side effects other than it stopped working for my acne after two months so I stopped taking it.  The acne has become worse than ever.  The hair loss returned although at a somewhat diminished rate than pre-Minocycline. The one remaining benefit is that the tonsil stones have not returned. It has been approximately one month since I discontinues use of the antibiotic. Originally, the dermatologist prescribed that I take the antibiotic for two months. I finished the course and the acne started to come back. At that time, I went to see my GP and she said, ""If it's working, keep taking it for up to the next 6 mos. to a year.""

It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week. The side effects I experienced while taking Effexor were insomnia, rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  Also, I found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk, watching tv, etc..  All in all, these were minor and as easy trade-off.  The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put, it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor. My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and, finally, to 150mg/day.  After taking 150mg/day for about a week, I felt it was too much...my heart was always racing, I couldn't sleep, and I generally just felt ""nervous"".  My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However, I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year, I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week, then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any ""withdrawal"" symptoms.  Within a few days of the last dose, all sexual functions were back.",high

retin-a,4,"retin-a sun damage - The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however. There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after. Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face.",Low

This might be a very good treatment for others with Tourette's Syndrome!! I feel very tired and i have a hard time focusing in class. But I think once i start getting used to this medication the focusing will come back. I have been suffering from anxiety for such a long time.

I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year. For the first few days I definitely had some diarrhea but it wasn't that bad.  Maybe some mild stomach cramping within that period too.  But I ate some yogurt with it before I took it at bedtime which helped curb any intestinal issues.  All of this went away within a week or two of taking it.  I also experienced some cotton mouth feeling and that lasted pretty much the whole time.  It wasn't too bad but noticeable.  I never had any taste disturbances. I took one pill a day, at night for 90 days with a big glass of water and never skipped a dose.  I had a few nights where I had some wine and champagne but never overdid it and tried to steer clear of alcohol as much as possible.",high

I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking, large social gatherings, dates, and other anxiety provoking situations. It really helps decrease signs of nervousness resulting from the fight-or-flight response, such as increased heart rate, sweaty palms, and dry mouth. none as above",high

My infection diminished progressively over the course of a week taking the prescribed dosage each day, I also noticed that the infection never reoccurred and has not since. Overall taking amoxil was not nearly unpleasant as I thought it would have been and it did the job I was told it would do side effects of treatment very rarely occurred and were minimal, however when I did experience side effects they were as follows : nausea, headache, stomach pain, dizziness, and loss of appetite.

tirosint,10,"tirosint low thyroid - I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower. I had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  I have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects, but this was a good experience.  Fortunately, the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment. As I said, my doctor spotted the symptoms and ordered a thyroid test.  When it came back very low, she prescribed 75 mg a day of levothyroxine, and I felt a little better almost immediately.  Within 2 weeks, I felt younger, more energy, better mood and my weight gain stopped.  I have enough energy to exercize and with only a slight shift in my fairly healthy diet to less fat and more fruits and vegetables, the weight has slowly come off.  I have my thyroid checked every 6 months with good results so far.  Between the medication and some dietary changes, my cholesterol is down from 230 to 206.  I still have about 6 pounds to get back to my starting weight.  Unless there's a permanent cure out there, I won't mind taking this little lifesaver forever.",high
dispermox,6,"dispermox sinus infection - The benefits of amoxicillin were that it did help clear the infection, it seemed to help my acne, also.  I noticed it working within about four days.  I only had to take it for a week.  It did not taste bad.  It did not make me foggy headed. the amoxicillin gave me some gastrointestinal upset.  After a few days, I had mild diarrhea.  It caused a vaginal yeast infection.  After the regimen was over, I felt more tired that usual.  I think the natural flora in my body was altered and somehow made me feel more tired.  I have taken this medication several times for different infections.  I was concerned about resistance. The amoxicillin was given in 500mg pill form 3 times daily for one week. It was inconvenient to have to take the medicine every 8 hours, but the physician recommended this time frame in order to keep the blood levels at a helpful level.  It meant having to wake up in the middle of the night to take it.",high

I would need at least 7-8 hours of sleep to not get groggy. 1/2 of a 10 mg pill as needed. Purposely would take it sparingly due to any addictive issues. Some doctors believe it is truly addictive; others not so. But I believe in as few drugs as possible in my life. I am also very afraid of any type of addiction. Therefore, I opt to split the pill in half and only take it 2-3 times a week.",high

I found that my blood veins would stick out all down my arms and hands during the next days after the treatment and that these veins would be very painful.  there was an ache throughout my arms and sometimes in my legs due to this sumatriptan. the optimum time for the shot is at bedtime and this is when I would take the shot and immediately lie down. my heart would race just after taking the shot and i would feel pain shooting through my body. but i have always found that the headace left EXCEPT if i had the shots too close together in that this seemed to stir up the headache for some reason.,high

I am now severely addicted to this medication with no way to get off it. Any attempt to stop taking the medication leads to severe physical and emotional pain. I agree that this medication has some positive effects but the negative side-effect FAR OUTWEIGH the good.

Cramps associated with diarrhea have disappeared. Increased energy, feeling active and generally feeling better.  Endoscopy was done at one point after the treatment and there was indication of only very mild disease so basically remission was achieved according to my gastroenterologist. Edema, weight gain, round face occurring about 3 weeks into the treatment. Insomnia, headache and hperactivity occurred at 50 mg daily, and subsided when dose decreased to 40 mg daily.
I was first diagnosed with Crohn's in 1980 and at that time not too much was known about effective treatments and so on.  My gastroenterologist at the time prescribed 5mg of prednisone daily for an indefinite period of time. This did not help at all, in fact I became sicker and sicker, lost a lot of weight and had frequent diarrhea and severe cramps all day. I became osteopenic and had a bowel perforation 2 years later.  The perforation was believed to be due to the long term prenisone I was taking.  I had a bowel resection done.  A new Gastroenterologist started me on a new treatment schedule. The new treatment schedule started with 50 qam for 1 week.  Decrease to 40 mg for a week, and then slowly keep decreasing by 5 mg daily, for a week at a time, until finished. Usually takes about a month. I only needed to take prednisone about once a year when flare-ups occurred.

lamictal,7,"lamictal epilepsy - Lamictal stopped my seizures as well as Epilim, but it gave me a considerate amount of energy.  Some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  My depression went away with Lamictal.  Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since Epilim gave me terrible cravings. I experienced hair loss at times.  I wouldn't have an appetite and throw up if I had something to eat. I get terrible mood swings.  In the beginning I would suffer from sleeplessness.  My body would be tired, but my brain wouldn't stop working.  Don't know how to explain it.  I've had a little rash, but nothing serious.  I've been an athlete my whole life, so training and staying in shape is a big thing for me, but since I've been on Lamictal I've gained a considerate amount of weight and not being able to lose it.  I've carried on training, but my weight just stands still, after all my weight gain.  I've managed to lose 5kg's in 3 years and that was an amazing achievement for me.  My weight has made me terribly depressed, since my body isn't accustomed to it.

I went back to my Neurologist, but after driving 400km's and paying R800, he told me that I'm talking nonsense, because Lamictal has never been said to make a patient pick up weight.  There's a first time for everything you know. 

I just don't know what to do, because I just can't carry on like this.  It has affected my cycling, my running, my swimming, but he clearly doesn't give a damn.

I put a lot of moisturizer on it in the morning, but need to reapply it throughout the day.

Quit before the 10 days were up.  1.5 years later, I am still not smoking. Very irritable and angry.  Fell into a depression. Within the first week I was very irritable but that is to be expected. I've quit for a couple of months before and this happened, too.  However, I completely changed.  I could not control my temper, I got very depressed. I didnt realize what was happening other than I just felt ""bitchy"".  After 3 weeks  I quit using the drug from 2/day to 1/day for a few days then quit.  Total I used it for about a month.  

I went into a severe depression in which I was either very angry, very sad or just felt numb. I cycled between those feelings. Nothing brought me pleasure, the things that used to love to do like dancing or  going out with friends, did nothing for me.  I didn't care to do them. I thought I was going crazy. I was like this for about 4 months before I started feeling a little better and maybe about 6-7 months before I felt like myself again.  

I still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  I consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.

tenormin,10,"tenormin tachycardia - The benefits were immediate relief from a ""racing heart"" or tachycardia caused by anxiety. I use this medicine prophylactically and found that it is very effective in controlling my heart rate and keeping it within a normal range. The only time it does not work is if I have a full-blown panic attack. At that point, other types of medications are used in addition to the atenolol. The side effects were mild but it did slightly lower my ability to determine if I was having an insulin reaction (hypoglycemia). However, once I adjusted to the medication, it was not a problem. Treatment was started immediately after an initial and severe case of tachycardia. An Echocardiogram ruled out any heart defect and I was started on 25 mg once per day. I stayed on this dose for about 6 years and was able to drop down to 12.5 mg per day for nearly a year.

You do not gain weight! I have taken most of the usual bi polar meds and felt like a fat zombie. 80mg of cialopram really works. Started at 20mg and slowly went up. I did trial many anti psychotics with it. Although the other meds worked the side effects were revolting. So I have just stuck with citalopram 80mg. There is a huge huge difference from 40mg to 80mg. I became a lot less manic at 80mg infact i am basically never manic at 80mg. Really this dose levels me out and i recommend it for anyone who suffers rapid cycling bi polar.

After the antibiotics, the number I would have on my face at one time decreased, but I developed cysts deep under the surface of the skin that would sit there for weeks (never happened before).

She was irritable when she was hungry, tired, or needed to poop.  But about 24 hours after her first dose of Cefdinir! Her moods drastically changed to violent, out-of-control, scary, temper tantrums.  To the point where she was biting herself, Banging her head on the wall and hitting and kicking us with all her might.  And when we would try and stop her, it was like she didn't recognize us and would get scared and cry. 

It was disturbing and very upsetting for us a parents. We started doing research the next day and little info on the drug except for druglib.com and the official side effect page. We found drastic mood changes buried in the side effects information and discontinued use.

Our doctor didn't seem that concerned even after we explained the scary details. He prescribed aZ Pack for her symptoms and she has been fine ever since (we have a new doctor now though). Our daughter completed her treatment with a z pack.",Low
aldactone,7,"aldactone acne - The Spironolactone has really helped my acne, especially the huge flare ups I'd have monthly with my period.  I do still occasionally have break outs, but they are usually less severe, shorter lasting, and confined to my face. The main side effect I've had is irregular periods.  First it was annoying, not knowing when my period when come.  Then as my period became less frequent, it was actually kind of nice.  However, now I feel like about 15 or 20 days into my cycle I start to bloat like normal, but don;t start or get relief for about another thirty or so days.  So, now I kinda feel like it's bloating or acne to choose from. I take two 50 mg spironolactone tablets each morning along with 50 mg od doxycycline.",high
amerge,8,"amerge migraines - Amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines. Mild drowsiness, sometimes mild nausea. I have very severe migraine disease and have tried many different treatments.  None are effective 100% of the time.  In my experience, Amerge is the most effective for mild and moderate migraines (Nothing seems to work for severe attacks). I prefer Amerge because the beneficial effects seem to last longer than many of the other anti-migraine meds (often 18-24 hrs.). Also, side effects seem to be negligible(No palpitations and dizziness like with imitrex). The downside is that Amerge takes longer to work (2-4 hrs) than the other triptans. But because of the better safety profile and the longer duration of effectiveness, for me Amerge is a top choice for migraines.",high

estring,8,"estring post menopause - Eased vaginal dryness for more comfortable intercourse.  Probably has a beneficial effect on my heart condition, since there is heart related problems in my family of origin. There were no noticeable side effects.

THERE WERE NO NOTICABLE SIDE EFFECTS...SPIRALACTONE ACTS AS A WATER PILL SO THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF URINATION.  THATS ALL... after two shots of cortisone to my knee, I had an mri done...this showed no problems yet the cortisone injections lasted only about four months.  My dr did not want to give additional injections and prescribed physical therapy, which I did, but it only aleviated the pain for a short time and never for an entire day.  My job requires me to be on my feet and I needed more relief.  I went to an internist (the first doctor was a bone and joint specialist) who prescribed spiralactone.  OK, I didnt have much faith in a water pill, but it worked and still continues to work.  I do not take many medications but I do make sure I never run out of this miracle.",high
climara-pro,3,climara-pro hot flashes - There was a small reduction in my hot flashes but the side effect was bothering me too much to stay on the patch longer to see if it would have totally eliminated them over time. I developed gas pains in my abdomen where the patch was. I was very bloated and uncomfortable.  I think I gained a couple of pounds too and I had only been using it for a week. The doctor thought I should try the patch because it would bypass my liver.

I would wash my face and wait 10 minutes so the skin was completely dry for application. I applied the cream to the cheek area and spread outward trying to avoid the sensitive corners of the mouth, nose & eyes. I decreased the amount when I began to get some peeling and then took a break from treatment when I got obvious irritation. At this point, the treatment has to be on and off a schedule to avoid the side effects.",high
adipex-p,4,"adipex-p loose weight - Well, I did not have an appetite all day.  But then at night, I was very hungry.  I only lost about 2 pounds in the week I took it. The side effects were bad.  I had a racing heart beat, difficulty concentraing and I could not sleep.  And the worst was the headache!  I wish I had taken my blood pressure.  I think it was probably very high. There are not treatment details really.  I was overwieghtand not loosing even though I was followinga strict diet and eating well.  I needed to up my metabolism.  It worked.

Disrupted sleep is the only side effect so far.  However, I'm military and deployed, so sleeping well in these conditions is a luxury anyway.  Vivid dreams...I'm remembering my dreams, which is not normal for me.  Occasional nightmare, and frequent waking. 2 pills a day as prescribed.  I recommend it, but results obviously vary.

zovirax,10,"zovirax herpes zoster - I have had Herpes Zoster or VZV all my life. Acyclovir completely eliminates the headache and flu like symptoms. If I take it early enough it stops all outbreaks in one or two days. If taken late; I need a higher dose and it can eliminate blisters in 2 or three days. My outbreaks were once or twice a year and I only used acyclovir cream. Now it appears less than once a year and can be stopped with Zovirax(Acyclovir). I get sleepy and buzzy headed. No other side effects from the medicine. I take three 400mg tablets in 24 hours for the first two days. This equals 1200mg in 24 hours. Then 800mg for two days.

prednisone,1,"prednisone allergic reaction on face to a cosmetic - Facial swelling reduced dramatically over 3 days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.  Since then I've learned that some physicians are quite blas� about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about ""first do no wrong"" is no longer important. constant :    pulse pounding throughout body, flushed face, odd-looking eyes (dilated), high blood pressure ( systolic range 145-194; ), fatigue, severe insomnia, nervousness, inability to concentrate, mild vertigo (spill, drop, lurch, and fall).

provigil,10,"provigil narcolepsy, sleep apnea, bipolar disorder - I am able to stay awake while driving.  I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming. During the first week, my heart rate increased as I increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  I believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well, but those are gone now too. I take my provigil every morning, 3 200mg tablets.  I am awake for about the first 4 hours, then I nap for a little while.  I am up for about 2 hours, and nap again.

adderall,10,"adderall adhd - This treatment was easy and highly effective. Adderall increased my overall energy levels, making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. It increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. The most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses. If taken too late in the day, it can interfere with sleep. It must be carefully controlled as it is addictive. The main side effect I have experienced though was pathological skin picking. I mainly pick at my legs, but the picking sometimes leaves small scars. It also decreases appetite, which means patients must learn new ways to remember to eat or to identify the need to eat. It can also increase blood pressure slightly. Adderall was taken once in the morning every day. This medication was combined with cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. Within the last year, neurofeedback (biofeedback to control brainwave patterns) was added. This treatment has been very effective, and will be continued as long as it is needed.",high

oxycontin,2,"oxycontin pain after surgery - The drug was prescribed for pain, and it worked to dull post op pain. The drug made me terribly constipated, which in my opinion, negated the value of the drug. The strain to eliminate was very painful considering the recent surgery. After 1 day of oxycontin and the ensuing constipation, I switched to 800 mg of ibuprofen. While not as effective for the pain, the constipation was alleviated. Overall, the ibuprofen was better for me.",Low
renova,8,"renova hyperpigmentation - Tretinoin, used in conjunction with the Obagi regimen, greatly reduced facial hyperpigmention which was due to hormones and sun damage. Severe redness, burning and peeling occurred in the first 6-8 months of use, but gradually dissipated. Tretinoin (pea size) was blended on the back of the hand with an equal amount of Blender (#5 step in the Obagi system).  The mixture was then applied to the face, neck and chest avoiding the eyes and lips. The residual cream remaining on the hand was spread on the back of the hands to reduce ""age spots"".

lexapro,1,"lexapro anxiety, stress - Eliminated or reduced symptoms of anxiety - eliminated heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Provided a general feeling of calm. The worst, and the reason for d/c'ing, side effect was hot flashes and night sweats that awakened me and interfered with my working.
Secondly, I felt drowsy during the day even on this low (5 mg day) dose. I tried taking at night and the trialed taking it in the AM and experienced no difference in the side effects. 
Both side effects are completely gone now that I have stopped taking it. I believe I have already done so.",Low

effexor,10,"effexor depression - The numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well. Initally when I started taking Effoxor it upset my stomach. I was taking in the morning after breakfast so the Dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation. I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.  After visiting the Dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to 100mg and eventually I increased it to 150mg.  This is currently the dosage I am taking.",high

aldactone,3,aldactone hormonal acne - Not much improvement in hormonal acne.

I still have cysts but but not as many (reduced by 30%).,Low
duragesic,7,"duragesic severe chronic pain - Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.) It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.) I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective.",high
paxil,8,"paxil panic disorder - The main benefit is the ability of the drug to reduce, even eliminate the panic attacks. The general mood is positively improved. Many listes un the literature, but in my case the worst are intermenstrual bleeding, back pain, laziness, abscense of sexual desire. I just take one 20 mg pill at night. Medical check-up once a year including lab tests.",high
synthroid,7,"synthroid hypthyroidism - Treatment benefits included a correction of my T3, but only a mild improvement in my emotional status. I am still irritable and mildly depressed. Weight gain of 20# in 4 months, continuation of my irritability and mild depression. Treatment involved radiation treatment to shrink my thyroid to correct my hyperthyroidism, followed by Rx with Synthroid to treat the hypothyroidism.",high
effexor,10,"effexor depression - The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems. The side effects are mild, but excessive sweating is one of them. I seem to sweat a good bit more than I normally did as well as sweat more than other people that I notice. Also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. Constipation can also be a side effect. The details in the treatment are just as I described shortly above. I went to the doctor, they prescribed it and I take it. Don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details.",high
cymbalta,1,"cymbalta fibromyalgia and depression - none I had little motivation, I felt like I was in a daze, my memory was worse I have recurrent major depression.

Muscle tension, laziness, daytime sleepiness, avoidant behavior. Lack of creativity - seems like I'm ""stuck"" in a routine. General irritability. Started with Celexa to treat anxiety/depression, then was diagnosed with adult ADHD, and started on Adderall. Abused Adderall for about a year (sometimes taking up to 120mg per day), but eventually returned to 30 mg.",high
imitrex,2,imitrex migraine headaches - The drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  The migraines were usually sseveral days long. I experienced slightly more gagging while dry heaving and nausea changed to sickening feeling and more stomach churning. Took Imitrex for a 3 month period and still had no noticeable results.  The tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  I ended up trying Aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.,Low
retin-a,4,"retin-a sun damage - The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however. There were really no side effects; perhaps the tiniest of tingling at the ery first couple of applications then none after. Topical application of the cream daily, usually at night. The recommended amount was ""pea sized"" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face.",Low
diazepam,5,"diazepam sleep - Most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  The liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie, 40 mins instead of 20. The benefit was there if I was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep. Twitching nerves for several days afterward.  Difficulty sleeping.

Decrease in skin lustre and elasticity Lost interest in sex rapidly, if I was ever aroused (very rare) I couldn't achieve an orgasm, every part of my body seemed to dry out and subsequently age a bit and in the case of my eyes this drying and ageing process was pretty severe. Doctors were baffled as to why I'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age, said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (I was 20-21 at the time). Now looking back I realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms I was experiencing at the time, many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. Considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (I now use the copper IUD), I believe they may well have been linked Yasmin. Yasmin is one scary pill- I came off it worried that I was prematurely going through the menopause and that I would never be able to enjoy painless, bloodless, pleasurable sex again.",Low
oxycontin,8,"oxycontin severe and chronic back pain - Truly allows me to function.  I work in a mentally demanding and stressful job.  Without this medication, I would not be able to work, let alone do much of anything else. Yes, there are side effects.  Constipation is an issue that requires trying different means to address.  Tradition treatments didn't help, but odd ones that I stumbled on have - like eating raw brazil nuts; now it's home-made chex mix.  NutriSystems food (with high fiber and fillers) really works.

There is a mild, physical addiction property.  Over the ten years that I have used this medication, I have slowly reduced by dosage from 50 mg down to 30 daily.  There was nauseousness and sweating, but I got through it.

When people say that prescription medicine isn't safe, I can only reply that my choices are either laying in bed because the pain is to great, or taking the medication and being able to function.  I am still limited in my physical activity, but I'm working and not constantly focused on the pain. I take the Oxycontin three times a day - morning, lunch and dinner.  It is recommended to take on a full stomach, though I've never noticed an issue when I haven't.  If I take my regular dose one to two hours after it's due, my back pain is very severe, so I know it's working.",high

fiorinal,8,"fiorinal migraines - Fiorinal almost always gets rid of my migraine headaches. Occasional drowsiness, though this is preferred as I usually need to lie down in a dark place when I have a migraine. I'd typically take one Fiorinal capsule at the onset of a migraine headache, with water and sometimes salted crackers. (If I didn't catch it at the onset, the capsule generally had no effect).  I would then lie down in a quiet, dark room.  The pill would typically reduce the headache within 30-45 minutes.  Occasionally I would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  Regardless, it has worked well to reduce headache pain.",high
claripel-cream,9,"claripel-cream melasma - Lightening of dark spots that I experienced on both of my cheeks from melasma. I noticed definite results within weeks; however, with only short periods of accidental sun exposure the dark spots would reappear. Make sure to use sunscreen and hats or avoid sun exposure completely to enjoy continued results. None I washed my face twice a day with gentle cleanser and applied the hydroquinone 4% twice daily. I also used a Retin A cream once a day that caused some irritation and redness, but when used alone, I didn't have this effect from the hydroquinone alone.",high
strattera,4,"strattera add - The 1st week  felt great.  All the racing thoughts were gone.  Mind was kinda empty and quiet.  I could concentrate.  I was able to think of a task that needed done and complete it.  Then move on to the next task.  Was only able to work on 1 thing at a time instead of going from one thing to the next without finishing anything. Could listen to the person talking to me without starting to day dream and lose the conversation. Was very happy with it. 1st 2 days had nothing in my head.  No thoughts at all.  Didn't talk because there was nothing to say.  I could understand people talking to me, but didn't have responses.  Kinda groggy. Took a nap on the 1st day, which is something I never do.  In my third week, feel like its stopped working.  Minds not racing like before, but feels like all my thoughts are blurry. Feel very blah, not motivated at all. Could sit all day and do nothing.  Before meds I ran around all day from one thing to the next and not finish anything.  I could be in the middle of folding laundry, then walk away to do the dishes.  I couldn't take my kids with me to the grocery store because their talking would distract me and I would forget things.  Taking a list wouldn't help because I couldn't write lists.  Now, I don't even want to do the laundry.  I don't want to do anything.  I wondering if changing the dose will help. Started out on 40ml.  Which I thought was kinda high because I only weigh 118.  Was told to go to 80ml after only 3 days.  I did that and could not sleep at all!  Was awake for at least 48 hours.  So the doc had me go back down to 40ml.  Which isn't working now.",Low

ambien,10,ambien restlessness - allowed me to sleep soundly without feeling groggy in the morning. I didn't have any side effects if I was allowed enough sleep.  If I did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and I would feel as if I had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  I would say at least 6-7 hours of sleep is needed. Take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  This prescription was issued for six months and I am currently still taking it.  It does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when I can sleep without it and do not crave it.,high
adderall-xr,10,"adderall-xr adult add - In a very short period of time, there was a mental clarity that I had never experienced. I felt a calm and order to my life and work. I was truly able to focus on important things that I needed to do and did so efficiently, which was something I was never able to do. Menopause exacerbated the extreme mental fuzziness that I had already been experiencing with 4 children and a more than full time job. This drug has truly changed my life for the better! I did not experience any side effects that were negative. I could hear better and think in a focused way within a short amount of time (30-45 minutes after taking the drug) I take a 30 mg. pill shortly after waking and within an hour, the fog that I chronically have had all of my life just lifts!",high
effexor-xr,9,"effexor-xr depression - The xanax helped slow things down and make everything less stressful. helped me to stay on a calm even level. unfortuntely it is extremely addictive and you can find yourself craving it, and everything can become a problem if I didnt have any.  Dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if I didnt have it.  Had to stop taking it as soon as I noticed my behavior. I want to say it was 50 mg. doses taken up to 3 times a day.  It was somewhat up to me when I needed to take it.  Mostly for anxiety attacks.",high
xanax,10,"xanax panic attacks - within 10 minutes the drug began to calm down the situation and I was able to function normally again. My racing heart rate was decreased, the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. I was able to eat again, and go about my daily routine. The only real side effect was that depending on the severity of the attack and the amount I took, as sometimes I cut the pill in half, or if the case was extremely severe, I could take up to 1 mg. was that I got very sleepy. In a lower dose that was not the case but in the higher dosage it did occur. The treatment details were to take only as needed and it could be taken up to 3X per day, but usually one pill did the trick. I didn't have a set protocol for taking the medication because the attacks were so random, they might not occur for months at a time, or they could happen two days in a row. So, I was told to take it only as needed. I still have a number of pills left from my RX of 30 last year.",high
cipro,8,"cipro uti - I had a bad uti with awful pain on myside i couldnt walk..I was prescribed this and have never taken it so I was a little nervous.

prozac,10,"prozac depression - Within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect! I have had no known side effects to this date. I do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and I have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected. I started on 10 mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well I went up to 40 mgs. This caused some insomnia and nervousness so my Dr. lowered it to 20 mgs. a day. There are still times I get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. I am looking at being on Prozac as long as my body toleates it, due to once being taken off I went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again.",high
celexa,1,"celexa depression - There were no benefits.  It did not solve the organic issues and created new problems. Firstly, this medication made me drowsy, and I often took involuntary naps mid-afternoon. Secondly, I had carbohydrate cravings, and felt hungry all the time. Lastly, after a couple of weeks I became weepy, irrational and anxious.  I can't imagine how magnified these symptoms would have been on a higher dose. I began taking Celexa after Lexapro made me sleepy and hungry.  The Lexapro did indeed calm my anxieties.  It was thought that an isomer of Lexapro might be better tolerated.  This was not the case, and now I am off all medications for a short period to re-evaluate my baseline needs.",Low
celexa,10,"celexa anxiety and mild depression - Citalopram turned me into myself again. I didn't really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. I have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. I wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. I feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. I have also experienced some weight loss while on Citalopram, probably because I feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! Additionally I've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly. In the first few weeks I felt a little shaky and experienced dry mouth. This was perscribed by my gynocologist and I plan to take it for the next year, then reasses my need.",high
zegerid,8,"zegerid laryngopharyngeal reflux - fewer Reflux episodes, less inflammation of the Eustachian Tube, lower cancer risk digestive problems: a few days per month Laryngopharyngeal Reflux has caused a Eustachian Tube (ET) dysfunction.

elavil,9,"elavil fibromyalgia - I was diagnosed with a mild case of fibromyalgia, I was not able to get a good night's sleep for years because of the symptons of fibromyalgia, muscle pain and tingling in my back and arms, and I was prescribed this drug to help me sleep at night. No side effects were experienced by me, just a good night's sleep. Before I started taking the pills I tossed and turned every night due to my symptoms and got very little rest, but the elavil helped me sleep thru the night and I woke up very rested and with very little pain. I took it for several years and stopped last year after I gradually cut back on my dosage, exercise and yoga have helped me manage my symptoms so I no longer needed help to sleep at night.",high
sotret,9,"sotret acne - the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit. extreme dryness, redness, flaking, chapped lips, and occasional lower back pain.  i used aquaphor twice a day all over my face and lips.  this is the only way i could look ""normal"" because my face looked like it was literally peeling off. i was prescribed 10mg of sotret once a day for 4 months in addition to being on orthotricylcen lo birth control pills as part of the pregnancy prevention program agreement.  i was to undergo a monthly blood test and see my dermatologist to assess how my body was tolerating the drug and whether i was improving or not.",high
xanax,5,"xanax to help me sleep after having a rapid heartbeat ep - The drug helped relieve the anxiety from worrying about the sudden return of the rapid heartbeat episode that happened at work without warning and under no stress. I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping. I noticed that after taking the drug for several days I became very irritable and short tempered.  The side effects stopped when I stopped taking the drug.  I have never taken it since. I stopped taking the drug after recalling a collegue of mine taking the drug after the death of her mother.  Her mood and personality changed to anger and paranoia as she was taking it for a long time. After suffering an exreme onset of a rapid heartbeat at work (it started while I was laughing, believe it or not) I saw a cardiologist who determined that there was nothing physically wrong with me, however I started having problems relaxing and sleeping at night for fear the condition would suddenly return without warning while alone or sleeping (I thought it might lead to a heartattack!).  The doctor gave me a prescription for Zanax which helped, but caused the undesireable side effect.  The condition never occured again.",high
fosamax,1,"fosamax osteoporosis - An increase of bone density after a year so I was told I went from being a sever case of osteoporosis to moderate.  I took Fosamax from 2003 to 2007, when my gynocologist switched me to Boniva.  From what I've heard lately, Merck knew of this problem but would not publish information regarding what could happen to other bones. April 29, 2010 I broke my femur (rt leg) mid-thigh due to a pre-fracture very possibly caused by taking Fosamax.  Clearly from the x-rays my body was trying to heal the fracture.  After walking I would notice an aching at the site about 3-4 months before it broke.  I did not fall hard nor far--just about a foot and landed on my right foot.  This is obviously a huge consequence for taking this drug. Surgery and rod implanted in my right leg, thigh to knee.  It is also a long recovery and rehabilitation from walker to crutches and cane.  I am taking calcium (Jarrow's Bone-up) twice daily, 50,000 units Vit D weekly, and will have a variety of tests regarding Niacin in about 2 weeks as a follow-up with my primary physician.",Low
chantix,5,"chantix stop smoking - To cease smoking.  I have a 40 year old habit! I had constant muscle aches, flue like symptoms, sadness that I could not understand, strong stomach pains,and constant fatigue.  Even combining aspirin and lots of food with my dosage, it did not help. A pleasant side effect were dreams in bold color. Not scary at all. Take one  1 mg tablet two times per day.  The first several days the dosage was one half until I worked my way up.",high
nortriptyline,8,"nortriptyline originally depression, later for chronic pain - good lifting of depressive feelings, reduction in chronic back pain associated with endometriosis and fibromyalgia Dry mouth and shaky hands . Shakiness subsided in 3-4 days Initially given Nortriptyline for depression.  It helped and after months of therapy the decision was made to discontinue.   I noticed an increase in low back pain that I had in the sacral area associated with endometriosis and all over body aches associated with fibromyalgia.

I read that Nortriptyline at that time was being experimentally used for neurological pain so I asked to go back on to see if it helped and it did.
ALthough I eventually had to have a hysterectomy due to the severity of the endometriosis I still had/have to deal with chronic pain of fibromyalgia.  I cannot tolerate the pain without the Nortriptyline 50mg at bedtime.

I would highly recommend a trial of this if you have any chronic pain issues at all.  Although other pain meds may have to be taken occasionally due to severity changes the Nortriptyline for me really cuts that down.",high

cymbalta,10,"cymbalta situational atypical depression - Cymbalta takes effect quickly -- within days, as opposed to weeks -- and relieves one's sense of hopelessness, futility and fatigue during a deep depression. At higher doses, a sense of purpose and direction to one's life was also restored, allowing the patient (in this case, me) to exercise better judgment and effective follow through on plans and decisions.

The symptoms were particularly bad during the summer, and whenever I was in a laying down position.  The symptoms greatly interfered with my sleep.  When using this spray on a regular basis, my nostrils are completely clear most of the time, and I have minimal nasal problems during my allergy season. None I believe the recommended dose is two sprays per nostril twice a day.  I found that a ""maintenance"" level of only one spray per nostril each day on works for me.",high

Personal benefits: i controlled my weight better, skin looked more radiant and menstruation pains were alot less than when i was not on the medication.  As i grew older though i have been warned of being on contraception after 32 and I am also a smoker, this apparently increases the risk of cancer.  However, after terminating the pill I had a huge amount of hair loss over 8 months which I was never warned about side effects - when leaving the pill - i started losing my hair - alot of it daily dosage, usually taken at night time, managed my weight, and helped with my skin as well as a contraceptive",high

I have more drive to be productive. I also find that I am much more friendly, talkative, and social. I find myself wanting to talk to my family and catch up with friends. I also have mild depression, and since starting vyvanse I was able to come off Wellbutrin because the Vyvanse gave me a very happy feeling in a natural way. The feeling is only slightly ""euphoric"". This medication makes me feel like a normal person should feel. Decreased appetite. I have lost 20 pounds over the past six months. I eat one or two small snacks during the day, but at night I will have a meal when the medication begins to wear off. I also drink alot more fluids due to the dry mouth, which is another side effect. Neither of these side effects are bothersome though. I could afford to lose an additional 20 pounds and i'm hoping vyvanse can help me with that. I used to OVER eat, and now i eat only when my body needs the energy, which is good. overall I would definitely suggest vyvanse if you are unhappy with your current ADD meds, or if you are thinking about seeing a doctor concerning ADD. I will say that if you are your child is under 18, or irresponsible concerning ""drugs"" be careful and keep an eye on your childs consumption. Even though they say vyvanse is non-addicting, the feeling while on it and the persona it gives is very much desireable in comparison to not taking it. Also, if you are already under weight you should try a natural stimulant like stratera instead.",high

I discontinued the medication because the side effects were severe and much worse than the condition prescribed for. About 24 hours after my second dose I developed sudden acute abdominal pain. I have never had a negative reaction to any medication before, and had rarely had any stomach pain in my life. This pain was so strong and intense almost like the pain of a labor contraction. But alas it was upper abdominal and not coming from my uteris. It came in waves and anything I ate or drank made it worse. I was very close to going to the ER. But since my temp, BP and HR were normal and I did not have any other obvious symptoms I toughed it out with a heating pad and curse words.

lexapro,6,"lexapro depression - The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases. On the plus side, I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction, but none were a problem.  However, it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal. The pills are administered once a day, daily, for as long as you think it's worth taking them.

While taking this medication it stopped working, confused, burst into tears, then just ""change my mind"", hyper ventillation. this was very frightening as I was taking the medication, it was increased and I felt that I was ""losing it"", not knowing that the medication had failed Initial weaning onto medication, then basically tweaking med as observed by practictioner with therapy. I decided to end the medication as it was not doing anything as a life benefit. this medication simply masks symptoms so that the patient ""feels"" functional.And most importantly, I no longer trusted it. I also now believe that DSM diagnois, as used in the general public (myself included) excuses inept doctors from forming medical diagnosis, doing the investigative work and testing to EXCLUDE biological conditions. Why do I think this? My 14 year old daughter ""mentally crashed"" and it was her thyroid, which affects among other organs THE BRAIN.

After taking this drug for about a half of a year, I decided that the side effects weren't worth feeling miserable...even if that means I was going to be bald.  The first month was okay, but after that I started having many emotional problems due to the hormone balance, I had difficulty receiving an erection, reaching orgasm, or being aroused in any way.  My relationship with my girlfriend suffered greatly. My testicles constantly ached and some days it was hard to concentrate on anything else because I was so uncomfortable.  After being off this medication for a few weeks now, I feel so much better.  Just a few days after I took my last pill I could tell a huge difference in the way I was feeling.  I would never take this medication again.  I believe this company should look at the side effects more and re-evaluate the statistics that they originally advertised.

I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells. The worst side effect for me is stomach upset and trips to the bathroom, especially in the morning after I've taken it. The feeling of being all cranked up is good when I have so much to do (others say this wears off) but it also makes me feel a bit anxious and unable to relax. I had mild sleep problems, mainly early waking. I'm really loving the increase in energy and the lifting of the black cloud, but sometimes I feel a little spinny.

Hyperhidrosis of axillae, which I found the most frustrating side effect. Severely reduced libido. Lethargy and general tiredness. I commenced this treatment due to clinical depression. I started off at a dose of 20mg a day and after initial improvement found that I needed an increase in the dose to 40mg per day. This seems to work more effectively for me. I became pregnant after approximately 10 months on the medication. I continued on with the same dose throughout the entire pregnancy. I did not breast feed. I then became pregnant very quickly again and continued on the medication for this pregnancy as well. Once again I did not breast feed. I have at times reduced my dose to 20mg which has been fine, however if I suffer a depressive episode I increase it to 40mg and generally find this is what I need to stay on.",high

I see a lot of people here saying they abandoned MetroGel after a few days because it initially made their rosacea worse. I had the same experience, but pushed through, and found that it worked wonders by the 2nd or 3rd week. You just have to deal with looking awful for a week or two.

advair-diskus,1,"advair-diskus copd - At first it helped. I did not realize at first that they were side effects. I thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. Then I began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue, anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with COPD. Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically. I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that. Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.

My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair. I went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the Advair. I still take Duoneb and Zyrtec. I stopped taking the Advair one year ago. I am just now recovering from the adrenal problem. My COPD has not worsened.",Low

I seemed to metabolized the drug quickly. Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed. 

Eventually my doctor retired, and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself, and he prescribes Adderall, 20mg early morning and noon, and 10 mg mid  afternoon.  The sustained release doesn't work well overall for me. My focus isn't as strong as it was on Ritalin, but there is no problem with anxiety, and I don't need the Xanax.",high

I don�t experience dry mouth (but I have always been a huge water drinker!), nervousness, irritability, insomnia, or that racing heart feeling. Appetite is reduced, but not to an un-healthy degree. Smaller portions at both meal time and snack time are all that you can manage during the day. However, in my experience I eat normal dinner portions. In fact, I feel that with this medication I am eating ample, healthy portions for my gender, body-type and build.  It should be noted that with this and other medications like it you are often so focused it is easy to forget to eat, but it will catch up with you later in the day. You will want the portions you should have had, but no longer have the hours left to spread them out. I set a timer to remind me it�s time to stop and have lunch. I take this medication once each morning and it lasts throughout the day and into the early evening. With this medication you must see your provider every six months to evaluate weight changes and effectiveness. During the 2 checks that I have had my weight has been consistent.

Extreme agonizing bone pain in neck and ribs; high fever for 1 1/2 days; debilitating pain in shoulder and neck to the point that I could not get out of bed for 4 days. I subsequently read that it can aggravate previous injuries where bones have been broken or damaged. I had an earlier neck injury and compression fractures in my spine. I believe these old injuries were antagonized by the Boniva. In order to counteract the side effects I took Benadryl for a possible allergic reaction and Prednisone to reduce inflammation. Had to take 2 Tylenol every 6 hours for pain. This drug has not had anywhere near enough testing. In the aftermath of my experience I have now heard for 4 seperate people that they know or heard of someone with a bad Boniva experience. This drug was once a solvent / cleaning product in industry.

levoxyl,9,"levoxyl thyroid disease - The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, TSH, T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again. My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin, and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing. Not sure theres much to describe. I had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg.

Taking oxycodone makes all the difference in my quality of life, because it allows me to live without otherwise constant pain in my back, ribcage and belly.  In the absence of this pain, my mobility/activity level is excellent, I can think and focus clearly, and I am free of the depression and frustration of what could be a debilitating illness. Occasional fogginess if otherwise fatigued; otherwise, I am surprised at the absence of noticeable side effects. As I am aware of the addictive potential of narcotics/opioids, I have deliberately requested a continued low dose (5 mg) and have made a point of not increasing frequency to more than three tablets a day.  During the week after chemo, I will sometimes experience a bit of breakthrough pain between doses, and will then take a low (325 mg) dose of acetaminophen.",high

Started off taking 200mg before a 12 hour shift, which made me have the jitters and a headache at times. So I then started taking 100mg before my night shift began and would take another 100mg 4-6 hours later. This stopped the headaches and jitters. On day shift I would take a 100mg, if needed.

The treatment is relatively simple and safe.  It is also supposed to decrease your chance of cervical cancer.  Take one pill each day and there is a 99 percent chance of not getting pregnant.

They say that a major side effect could be impotence and a loss of sexual desire, but I did not experience either of those. Other than that, I can not really think of any other side effects I have experienced with Propecia over the last three years. I take one pill each day. Sometimes when my prescription runs out, I am forced to miss a few days, but I do not notice any changes as I think the medicine takes a longer time to work and stop working.

I've tried to go off the medication but whenever I do, negative thoughts and the resulting emotions return. When I resume taking Prozac, the symptoms subside. The medicine allows me to challenge thoughts rather than react to them. I have problems sleeping--not falling asleep but staying asleep. I sometimes feel nervous (that is, nervous energy, not anxiety). I'd also say that Prozac can make me feel numb, but it's better than being severely depressed.

singulair,2,"singulair asthma, allergies - some reduction in lung inflammation Severe mood swings, depression, frequent lung infections I took singulair for years before I realized that it was not really doing much and I strongly suspect that it contributed to my severe depression and mood swings.  I have always had severe asthma and allergies and was hospitalized many times as a youngster.  I did have allergy shots which I truly think helped with my allergies.  When I got older, and inhaled cortisteroids were invented I started taking them, along with Singulair.  I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25, I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well, have to start the Singulair again, that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.  I started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.

duragesic,6,"duragesic rheumatoid arthritis joint pain, fibromyalgia - Relief from hip and shoulder pain, tingling painful feet in the mornings when I would first walk around. I also received relief from lower back pain and as such allowed for better sleep to occur. There is also comfort in knowing that as my illness progresses and as I age that relief is out there for me when and if I choose to use it again. Soemtimes the skin where the patch was placed became sore, itchy, red and inflamed. However, the most problematic side effect was during the transition phase between each 30 day prescription. For example, if the pharmacy did not have the product, I would have to go without a patch for a day or two I would experience withdrawal symptoms, jitteriness, crawling skin, sleeplessness with dizziness. The whole ordeal of getting in to see the doctor every 28 days, getting the prescription,, well, it all was getting so stessful I just went cold turkey and quit using them. Which, by the way, was pretty foolish because I had a difficult three days by myself to say the least. I was having considerable hip and shoulder pain.  Also, I had significant sciatic pain but the sciatica pain was not as chronic as the shoulder pain.  While using the fentanyl patch I was given facet block injections and as a result have had little problem with the sciatica.  The fentanyl patch also relieved tingling pins and nnedle like pain in my feet that I had in the mornings when I first woke up and put even a little of my weight down on my feet.

The side effects are not seen if any because if the exist they are better than this incredible terrifying experience of hyperthyroid episodes that were haunting, and devistated my life in many areas. Am drinking fluids, one of my side effects of the hyperthyroid was not being able to eat or hold down food, but very hungry all the time. I am on liquids and increase to solids slowly now. I saw my primary doc, and ER doctor all to be diagnosed as panic attacks. I lived on and off of valum, and other anti depressants, and nothing would ever control, only blanket my tremors and shaky clouded mind. One ER doctor decided to run the thyroid tests that came back positive for Hyperthyroidism. I saw a specialist who then immediately put me on Methimazole 10mg, 1 time a day untile iodine test can be done. Delerious as I was over a week ago, I held couch in lost world of confusion. Tonight my ears stopped popping, ringing is gone, heart beating nice. For this night I believe that the Methimazole is starting to work. I am not tired, and feel like going outside. Unbelievable. If this is the beginning to my life back, this drug has the key to sanity for the upcoming choices for long term treatment and care I must make soon. Note: Due to contrast given in CAT Scan, I must wait 6 weeks to undergo the iodine testing. I understood that the contrast would throw off test results.

The chronic itchiness that was associated with the hives also began to lessen.  The greatest benefit of taking Singular was that the overall hyper-sensitivity of my skin was finally beginning to lessen. The side effects of the treatment was extreme tiredness.  This antihistamine caused me to fall asleep at odd times throughout the day.  I am generally a high energy person but Singular caused me to fall asleep almost as soon as I sat down or stopped moving. After many tests and a variety of test treatments my dermatologist determined a course of Singular would be the best course of treatment for the chrnic hives I was suffering from.

On the 4th day on the medication the patient who had been very responsive and alert was groggy, not alert and fell several times in attempts to go to the bathroom, something he had no problem with proir to the medication.  In attempting to assist the patient, it was evident that his heart was beating rapidly and he was in a cold sweat.  He died on the 5th day on the medication. The patient was suffering from cancer of the esophagus, which was in an advanced state at the time of diagnosis.  The patient was to begin treatment for cancer the day following his death.  He had received a feeding tube through his stomach and was sent home from the hospital with a perscription for Fentanyl patches for pain.  He had previously been taking a much milder medication.

This drug is poison and should not be given to children.  My daughter was prescribed this for mild asthma.

depo-provera,8,"depo-provera birth control - The main benefits were absolutely no pregnancy and no menstrual cycles. The main side effects, which I noticed more predominately in the later stage of treatment was the contast hunger and weight gain as the result, moderate acne, and depression (I am still being treated for depression so this may not be due to depo, but it is actually one of the side effects). I started depo-provera when I was 15 years old and continued treatment for five years and then stopped treatment at the suggestion of my doctor to take a break from it.  During the first ive years on depo, I had no adverse effects I maintained a constant weight of 112-1/2 pounds throughout the entire five years.  I started depo again at the age of 23 and was fine and maintained a constant weight until they switched me to the generic version at the age of 27 from that point on I struggled with constant hunger rapid weight gain and struggling to keep it under control, acne is another of the side effects I experienced after the switch to generic and depression.  The depression could be the result of fluxuating weight and acne or heredity.  I stopped depo treatment and switched to the copper IUD in November of 2007 and since then the constant hunger has stopped, I have already lost 10 pounds without really trying and the acne is beginning to decrease.  I still am receiving treatment for depression at the moment.  Hopefully, this will help you in your birth control decision.",high
elidel,8,"elidel hypothryoid-related dry skin - Elidel reduced my dry skin by about 80-85%. It increased exfoliation, which is very slowed down in hypothyroid-related dry skin, got rid of many of the blocked pores due to poor exfoliation, and stopped the vast majority of the flaking, burning, and redness I had suffered from before I used it. The first week I used Elidel I got some flu-like symptoms, as warned on the package insert. It stands to reason that Elidel would make one very sun-sensitive, as it shuts down the skin's immune system; I didn't have a problem with this, as I always wore sunscreen, but it made me nervous. As I understand it, Elidel isn't formulated to help the skin help itself; instead it just shuts off the skin's erroneous response. For some skin conditions, this is sufficient, but it wasn't for me. After washing my face with gentle cleanser, I applied a small amount of Elidel to my entire face, before following up with a moisturizer (or two), then sunscreen.",high

This is the first time that anything has made any difference. When I first started on the maximum dose of 300 mg twice a day I did experience dizziness,mild muscle twitching, short term memory problems and constipation.  The dizziness and muscle twitching did ease off after about 6 weeks but I still have constipation and seem to have difficulty remembering certain things. I started on 50 mg twice daily and I was got no reduction in pain, my doctor gradually increased the dose to 300mg twice daily. Once I was on the maximum dose, I started to experience some dizziness etc as outlined above.  However some of the  Side effects became less obvious after about 6 weeks on the maximum dose.

The use of the diclofenic greatly reduces the inflamation and allows me to use my hands for longer periods of time.

This combo therapy has not resulted in a total cessation of eyelid spasms, but has reduced them enough so that I can drive again (the main disability caused by the blepharospasm).  Taking the clonazepam at night also helps me get a better night's rest than before I took it. The first few days I took it I was dizzy and very sleepy.  However, those side effects have now subsided.

strattera,7,"strattera adhd (predominantly inattentive) - The ""head made of air"" feeling I tend to have goes away:I become more attentive, much more aware of my surroundings, feel much more grounded in the ""here/now"", and much better able to focus. My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not ""crash"" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive. Severe grogginess, often accompanied by lightheadedness, upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food, become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water. Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication, and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not ""crash"" from it!",high

However, the effects are only temporary. As soon as I stop using it, after a few days I will get blackheads again. I really did experience redness and flaking, like most users did. But that was mainly around the soft tissues, such as my mouth. So I decided to use it more on the trouble areas and less on the other parts. Side effects were reduced after combining with Jojoba Oil. I applied a pea size every day. You really do have to wait 20 minutes after washing your face before applying, because otherwise you will really have an increase of the side effects. Then wait a bit longer to let it absorb and use a moisturizer which is non comedogenic, like jojoba oil. Worked fine for me! And I have very sensitve skin.",high

When erection was achieved it went away quickly. The strength of erection was minimal. Not impressed at all. Massive headache an hour or so after ingesting the pill as well as heavy clogged sinuses. Found it hard to breath. Felt like flu symptoms. The only thing this pill gave me was strong flu-like symptoms. I'll try it again and see if the results are better but so far I'm not impressed at all and $80 in the hole. Complete waste of money and suffered flu symptoms the entire next day.

I am not so short tempered and I am able to handle situations that are mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also notice the benefit of not being very emotional. My physician and I decided to wean me down to 20 mg. and when this happened, I noticed an immediate effect.  I was very short tempered and ""on edge"".  I was also not able to deal with situations that were mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also was very tearful. Needless to say, my physician and I knew I needed to go back on the medication again. A slightly lowered libido, tiredness in the evening.

Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification. There were no long-term side effects.  The first several evenings his stomach pain seemed to increase so the frequency was reduce to twice daily for the first 2 weeks. Treatment consisted of Prevacid (1.25 mg) three times a day and at this time the duration is indefinite.

In the morning I woke with a cold sore and a very large ulcer on my tongue.  I attributed this to the slight fever I had been running periodically.  My tongue became increasingly sore.  The second pill, later on that day, caused sever stomach pain, cramping, diarhea, nausea, and hot flashes.  The oral pain remained about the same. I took the third, and last, dose that afternoon is the worst experience I have ever had with a drug.  Immediately after taking the pill blisters began to appear wherever the pill had touched my skin.  This included the entirety of my tongue, mouth, lips, and throat.  I called the PA that had prescribed the drug and told her about the reaction.  She told me to discontinue the drug immediately and that was a possible side effect of this drug.

cymbalta,9,"cymbalta anxiety - Significantly reduced anxiety without feeling 'damped down' or 'numbed'. Feel normal, but with reduced anxiety. Compared to short-halflife anti-anxiety medications, no feeling of emotional dependency on a once-daily ongoing regimen. Generally rarely experience side effects. Taken on an empty stomach, mild transient nausea, but this is quickly addressed with any light snack. Discontinuation syndrome (when I have run out of the medication, or once when discontinued for 2 days due to elective surgery) is quite unpleasant. Prescribed to act synergistically with stimulants prescribed for ADHD: the stimulants tend to increase anxiety, which also increases the necessary therapeutic dose for the stimulants, so this very low dose of the multiple reuptake inhibitor effectively reduces the dosage needed of the stimulant for therapeutic effect. This combination enabled me to reduce my stimulant dosage by 50% and also decreased my anxiety very substantially--the effect was almost immediately remarked on by my partner as well as in my own subjective opinion.",high

Extremem fatigue, dizziness, feeling of emptiness, pain in all tendons which is worsening as the days go by. I have been off of cipro for four days and the pain woke me up in the middle of the night.  I have had a terrible headache and my temperature is either very hot or cold.

I have never had tendonitis, but i am shocked that i could potentially be forever burdened with it.  My elbows, ankles, knees, hips and thighs, shoulders, neck ..all  of it in extreme pain.  Last night began the horrific nightmares. I went to urgent care because i was having severe kidney pain and i found blood in my urine.  The dr. too found blood and protien and suggested this drug.   I mentioned that i rarely take even and aspirin and am prone to side effects.  I also mentioned that a week earlier i had bloodwork done and it showed an inflamed liver.  I waited for the office to call me with the results which they never did.  Finally i called and they said they had lost my number, but yes indeed i did have a UTI.  (8 days later).

desonide,4,"desonide exzema of the face - the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. I thought that I had been cured of the skin rash. It cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash. It turns out it did not cure it at all but possibly hurt my face.  It also may have made the condition spread to other areas of my face because in time I had other areas of my face where the rash was.  The cream was only a temporary relief to a deeper situation. If one is looking for fast relief it will help but it covers up an initial problem that needs to be addressed. I saw a few dermatologists and each one told me to use it twice daily. I was even given different forms. One a cream and the other a foam.  I was also informed to use them for two weeks and then stop. I did, and when I stopped my rash slowly started coming back.",Low
retin-a-micro,7,"retin-a-micro to reduce/eliminate wrinkling - By using this treatment a minimum of every other day, I noted that the lines around the eyes (crows feet)were diminished greatly. Also, the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. I have, at times, gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time, particularly during the summmer when the Florida sun is at its most intense. Initially, the skin has to get used to the treatment.  I experienced redness and moderate flaking in the first 2 weeks (at different intervals). However, the skin eventually becomes tolerant of the product.  There is still the periodic sloughing of dead skin cells; but that's okay because you'll have a fresh, healthy glow afterwards. Retin A is a simple topical application to use.  I use it sparingly, minimum every other day, on my face and neck. I plan to continue using this product as part of my anti-aging regimine.",high

protonix,9,"protonix functional dyspepsia - I have/had an extremely easy to irritate stomach, over-sensitive to acid and food consumption. I spent most days feeling unbelievably bloated, even after only a few bites of food, sometimes. Protonix was prescribed to me in combination with Domperidone to reduce bloating, belching, and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach. None, really, that I can specifically blame on this drug. I had actually reacted fairly badly to other, similar drugs. The famous ""purple pill"" Nexium had actually given me a brutal headache, sore-throat, and even a racing heart-beat at times. I was somewhat anxious about taking another very similar medication, but Pantoprazole did not bother me at all (I have since read that Pantoprazole is one of the acid-reducers least likely to cause side-effects). Treatment has been ongoing for several months and is set to continue. While still not quite ""normal"", I am feeling much better after several months of this therapy and will be discussing reducing my dosage and/or going off the drug completely in the next month or two.",high
prozac,1,"prozac depression - My depression was significantly alleviated.  I would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some ""padding"" between me and the bad feelings. There were actually no physical side effects, but I found that I said a lot of things I wouldn't normally say, and which I was embarassed about later.  Prozac made me feel like everything was fine, so I didn't take things seriously enough, and didn't take care of things which really needed to be taken care of.  I feel like I wasn't a good parent during that time, because my attitude was ""eh...who cares?...everything is fine"".  

I also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.  However, once I managed to make it through a full week without it, I felt fine, and have never had to use it again. I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same, but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately, as I noted above, I don't like the way I acted during that time, and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy, that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately, life is not perfect, and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back, if I had faced my depression head on, and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run.",Low

It also appeared to enhance the recovery rate from this prolonged infection. The patient was extreemly hungry on this medication and some weight gain was observed.  In this case, this was a positive side-effect as the patient was very underweight.

No other side-effects were noted however the treatment regime was difficlut for an elderly person to understand and needed the support of a family member to ensure that doses were not missed. 40mg (8 tables of 5mg) taken for 5 days then 7 tablets taken for 3 days, 6 for 3 days, 5 for three days until taking one talbe for three days then stopping.

Spotting between periods (started off heavy like a period, but lightened up as time progressed), breast tenderness (do to fluid build-up),  breasts became larger in size (once more, do to fluid build-up), and bloating. Although the beginning stages of taking the pill were somewhat uncomfortable, Seasonique has remained a staple in modern birth control.  I would suggest this medication to any woman that is tired of dealing with a period every month (which is the majority of us).  The only thing that you need to keep an eye on, besides taking the pill everyday, is when its time for your cycle ITS THERE!  Even though you're on the pill does not mean you still can't get pregnant.  Take tests every three weeks to ensure there are no surprises in store for you.",high
effexor,5,"effexor depression - After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences. I don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. The more severe side effects became apparent after I began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. At that time, although I withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period, the tinnitus was quite pronounced, especially after any sudden head movements.  I often felt dizzy for no reason. I'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose, escalating to a higher one.  This was done in reverse when I decided to stop taking Effexor.  In retrospect, I'm not sure how much it helped me but had I known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication, I probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative.",high

naproxen,8,"naproxen nerve damage/ acdf surgery - Benefits of Naproxen helped with inflammation in the neck. Having a herniated disc the size of a plum impinged on a nerve for about a year and a half caused permanent nerve and muscle damage in the right arm. After surgery there was immediate relief however, because of the damage there are still issues with pain and inflammation. There are also still 2 bulging discs in the same area as the 2 herniated discs that were removed and replaced (i.e.) ACDF surgery. At times there were stomach irritations as a result of Naproxen. It caused acid reflux to be moderate to severe at times. Taking with food helped and at other times it was necessary to take a medicine for the upset. Treatment for inflammation in the cervical spine after ACDF surgery was necessary to remove 2 discs that were herniated and had a nerve severely impinged. As a result of nerve impingement there is permanent nerve damage and muscle damage. Almost 2 years after surgery still see doctor monthly for inflammation and pain.

After taking amitriptyline I am able to go to sleep in an hour or so. As for the Copaxone who knows? I have had only one flare up since starting it. The Detrol was horrible. My mouth was so dry my tongue  literally stuck to the roof of my mouth making it difficult to speak. The Copaxone causes lumps and itching at the injection site. When Zyrtec alone didn't controll my allergies my doctor prescribed the Veramyst to try. This combination seems to be working, Zyrtec once a day and Veramyst twice daily.

xanax,10,"xanax anxiety - Xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either I need fast relief (one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines) or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation (i.e relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives.) The only thing to be aware of with this drug is that it is very short acting so while it may be perfect for situational anxiety (e.g a speech, social event, dentist etc) its not a good idea for people with more generalised anxiety as its short acting nature may mean that people get rebound anxiety and then feel the need to dose again (can lead to dependance.)

prinivil,8,"prinivil high blood pressure - It lowered my blood pressure from borderline high (140/90) to normal (about 120/75).  This treatment worked most of the time.  THe only time it did not work as well was when I was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  During those times, even with the lisinopril, my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level. For over a year after starting the treatment I believe I had a side effect of a dry cough that was probably caused by this drug.  It was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when I temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  When the coughing was at it's worst, my blood pressure went up, nullifying the effect of the linsinopril. In spite of the irritating coughing, I continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one Dr. thought it was because of acid reflux), the coughing finally subsided.  After about a year of coughing, the coughing finally subsided and now (5-7 years later) I don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril.",high

I built up an immunity to the effects of Imitrex. I took them more often and needed to take more of them. I was eventually taking nearly 3 per day.

singulair,10,"singulair asthma - Singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  If I forget to take it, I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact, I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair. There are no apparent side effects of Singulair for me. My asthma had become so bad that when I was to be administered a test where I would be exposed to irritants to guage the severity of my asthma, I did not even get past the saline control before my breathing was adversely affected.  I would say that my experience with Singulair has been superior (only surpassed  by Advair, which I had to stop using due to the fact that my insurance company wouldn't cover it anymore.

At the time of diagnosis, I only had symptoms of mild fatigue which could have been the result of many other conditions There were really no overt, obvious side effects of the treatment.  levothyroxine is known to cause insomnia.  It may have been coincidence, but my sleeping habits deteriorated approximately at the same time I began therapy.  I am currently in the process of reducing my dose to see if sleep habits improve, but lab values remain at good levels As I mentioned above, my diagnosis was based almost exclusively on labratory tests.  TSH and T4 (thyroid hormone) were found to be too high and too low, respectively.  Relatively non-descript symptoms accompanied the list of complaints at the time of diagnosis.

My days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. This drug finally gave me relief. No side effects. Unlike another user claims, this drug does not ""teach"" your body to produce more acid.  Once it's out of your system, it's out of your system, and yes the symptoms of acid reflux will likely return because this drug is not meant to cure any underlying condition, but simply to manage the painful symptoms of GERD and other problems with producing excess stomach acid.  I will probably have to take it forever, but it's worth it to me to take a medicine every day versus suffering every day with constant heartburn and acid reflux.",high

There was some periodic itching. My skin became more sensitive and something like a scrape would hurt. Additionally and most noticeably even though I avoided my eye area the differin would make the skin around my eyes sore, red and flaky. I'm not sure how it spread to my eyes when I avoided rubbing it in anywhere close, but it did. I was directed to apply once or twice a week and build up to once per night as tolerated. I was able to tolerate once per night application for the entire course of treatment.

Lyrica makes it easy and painless to sleep and in the morning I can walk and drive without worrying if my legs will go numb. After taking Lyrica I developed tinnitus.

chantix,1,"chantix quitting smoking - The only time I didn't want to smoke was when I was so nauseous and or throwing up after taking the medication. I seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication. nausea, vommiting, depression, vivid dreams, and nightmares.  The vommiting came on within minutes of ingestion and my physician offered no other dosage or medication to alleviate the side effects. I was to be on this course of treatment for a possible 12 weeks....From the onset of treatment, I experienced every one of the adverse effects and was told that after a few weeks they would subside...So was not the case in my situation...I finally gave up as my life was severely impacted by using this medication.",Low
clonazepam,8,"clonazepam sleep walking/talking - This drug is very effective in making me sleep well, and works as a paralytic on my brain to keep me from sleep walking/talking.  It has also cut down on my migraines since I started taking it. Daytime drowsiness, highly addictive, bad withdrawal symptoms which caused terrible insomnia. I took 1mg at night (up from an initial 1/2 mg dose) before bed as a treatment for sleep walking/talking and the inability to progress to deep sleep. This medicine worked great at first, but after 6 months I was no longer seeing a benefit.  The doctor took me off of it for 2 weeks as a drug holiday to let my brain rest, and had to put me on another med during that time because I had terrible insomnia as a result of withdrawal (I have never had insomnia in my life).  I do have some short term memory problems, but overall saw a bigger benefit to feeling better and an increased quality of life to stop taking the drug.",high

Iritability decreaed while on this medication.  This medication has worked wonders for me. None at all for me.  I have tolerated this medication very well. Started this medication in October 2008 for my suspiciousness of people (thought people were out to get me).  Began at 0.25 mg once a day for a week, then increased to 0.5 mg a day at night.  3 weeks later (1 month from the time of starting risperidone), increased to 1 mg every night.

Depression set in (for outside life factors...not due to medication) and fluoetime added at 10 mg a day and risperidone decreased to 1 mg a day due to flueoxetine increasing the levels of risperidone.  Depression still there and psychotic symptoms came back.  At next vist (1 month) flueoxetine increased to 20 mg every morning and risperidone increased back to 1.5 mg a day.

If you gain weight on this, it's your own fault for eating too much! =] The only thing I can think of is when I go to the bathroom it comes out a bit, but nothing that can't be fixed immediately.

protonix,9,"protonix peptic ulcer - The benefits of taking Protonix 20 mg is that my ulcer cleared up, and I was able to resume eating what I call normal foods.  I changed and stopped eating pizza, meat balls or extremely spicy foods, but if possible I will take a Tums before just to reduce any chance of problems. I don't believe I had any side effects.  I know Protonix just like Nexium can be an addictive medicine simply because it work so well.  Some people seem to have minor side effects, but I am in great health and in good shape and I did not seem to have any side effects from using Protonix. I was prescribed Protonix 20 mg which I took daily for 30 days.  Extended use is not recommended, and I did not surpass the 30 days.  I do buy extra strength Tums and take it if I have any real acid or spicy foods.  The bottom line is I had a lot of pain with my ucler which came out of nowhere and after almost 2 weeks of pain I decided I needed to see a doctor.  Soon after taking Protonix my pain went away, but as with any ulcer a diet change might be in order.  Similar drugs are Nexium, Prevacid, Prilosec, etc.",high

My doctor prescribed celebrex to treat an injury i sustained while playing tennis. i damaged soft tissue ligaments/muscle tissue to the in-side of the knee, which became heavily swollen, painful and inflamed.
I was prescribed this drug as I am allergic to Ibuprofen based pain killers.

Initially I experienced slight tingling and intermittent dull ache to areas around the side, uppersides and rear of the cranium.
It felt like pulsing which lasted about 2 seconds before fading away. and continued the cycle ranging from 1 minute to 20 minutes in duration at different times of the day. this occured a day into starting treatment.

My doctor put me on 1 pill/day, .3, 1.5, and then I started to decrease the dose slowly to 1/2 pill per day, then 1/3 pill/day, then 1/4 pill/day.  Now I take one pill/week.

zyrtec,10,"zyrtec atopic eczema - The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition. It did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what I expected (I took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation). I felt slightly tired after taking Zyrtec. However, this was not severe and I always took it in the evening because the information leaflet did mention that the drug can have these side effects. I was also always slightly more tired in the following morning (about 8-9 hrs after taking the drug) than typically. This is a non-prescription drug and I took it because I was experiencing severe itching caused by eczema. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I only took it about 4 times when the itching was very bad, and it did alleviate it. I always took 1 pill a day.",high
tramadol,5,"tramadol fibromyalgia pain - In order to get any effects, I had to take 4-5 times the prescribed dosage.  The medication is simply VERY WEAK.  This drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level. I did not experience any side effects on a normal or high dose.  A VERY HIGH dose (only taken accidentally, because I forgot I had taken my usual dose earlier) on an empty stomach, will produce an unpleasant ""high"" feeling mentally, including spaciness and shakiness.  Therefore you can't just keep taking more and more of the drug. Bottom line, this drug just isn't very effective.  It's more effective, and SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER, than the NSAIDS that docs are still prescribing for fibromylagia.  But I am looking for better daily pain management.",high
trazodone,10,"trazodone chronic severe insomnia - This medication was the only thing that was able to put me to sleep regularly after over 20 years of chronic insomnia! There were no side effects. I usually took 150 mg. per night.  Occasionally it would have trouble falling asleep again, and then I would increase the dose to 200 mg. for a few days.  I would then go back to 150 mg. once I got back into a regular sleeping pattern.  Although Trazodone is a mild anti-depressant, I did not notice any difference in my mood.",high

I got my prescription for Retin-A Micro refilled about 2 months ago because it worked so well that I ran out of it! Now when I get acne and I apply the cream before bed, I wake up and there's no difference. The acne's still as big and as red as before. My skin must've gotten used to it or something, because it doesn't get rid of my acne. I apply it before bed each night and the acne's still the same.

The patient experienced some side-effects, including dry-mouth/increased thirst, dry skin and increased mild acne, and some mild sexual side-effects. The patient has attempted to combat all side-effects with increased water consumption. The patient was diagnosed with ADHD after describing a pattern of focus, memory and affect regulation problems she had experienced consistently since early childhood. The patient was given an initial prescription for Adderall XR in a 20 mg/day dose. The patient experienced an immediate improvement in her condition, which lasted for nearly three months. At three months, the patient described a waning of the positive effects of the medication but e reticence to increase the dosage without first pursuing other modes of treatment.

vyvanse,10,"vyvanse adhd - Increased focus, attention, productivity. Better able to pay attention and absorb information in class. Reduced impulsivity. Increased motivation, increased mood. Lasts much longer than other ADHD drugs with much less severe side effects. Restless legs at night, insomnia, headache (sometimes pretty bad). Also, make sure you take it and THEN START PRODUCTIVE THINGS, otherwise you attention will be focused on whatever you are doing when it starts to work, i.e. playing online games for hours. I took adderall once as a child, and it made me so miserable that I never wanted to take it again. Concerta did nothing for me either, and as an adult, vyvanse was the first ADHD drug I was put on since I was in elementary school. I've been on 50 mg, 70 mg, and 60 mg. 60 works best for me, lasting about 7 hours. 70 mg kept me from being able to fall asleep and 50 mg only lasted about 5.5-6 hours. I am able to pay attention and absorb the information in my classes. I also found that vyvanse put me in a good mood for the day!",high
zoloft,1,"zoloft depression - Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness. Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy. I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life.",Low
climara,2,"climara total hysterctomy - --- Constant issues with the patch not staying on.  I called the manufacture (Bayer), they took down the lot number and said we are sorry.  They said they were going to send a new box to my local pharmacy at no charge.  I have checked every week for the last three weeks and NOTHING!  Yeah, great way to follow through.  Throughout being on the patch I noticed large acne on my face, lack of energy, no libido, vaginal dryness, daily hot flashes and extreme moodiness (so sorry to my husband, even though he has been great through all of this).

During each time when I increased the dosage, I founf the side-effects worsened, but after a week or so, the side effects minimized and then disappeared.",high
micardis,4,micardis high blood pressure - The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related. I find when I am taking Micardis that I tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased. I take Micardis in pill form once daily.,Low
biaxin,9,"biaxin sinus infection - The antibiotic may have destroyed bacteria causing my sinus infection.  But it may also have been caused by a virus, so its hard to say. Some back pain, some nauseau. Took the antibiotics for 14 days. Sinus infection was gone after the 6th day.",high
lamictal,9,"lamictal bipolar disorder - Lamictal stabilized my serious mood swings. One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog, I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling.

Interestingly, I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams. Drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness. If you take too much, you will feel sedated. Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. I found that 400mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. Less than that and I can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (I like it to last 24hrs, from sleep to sleep). More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now. It's something that requires discipline. If you are in a field which requires creativity, expect to see a change in your output. Severe mood swings between hypomania and depression with suicide ideation before Lamictal. Began with 10mg and tritrated up to 400mg over a few months. Played around with the dosage to finally arrive at 400mg. Experimented with taking it at different times in the evening. Found that most comfortable time is before sleep.",high
depakene,4,"depakene bipolar disorder - Initial benefits were comparable to the brand name version of this drug, Depakote.  I had been taking Depakote for several months and experienced great results.  When I went to my psychiatrist for an evaluation and re-fill, he accidently prescribed the generic version, Depakene.  When I discovered the error, I was told by this doctor that I would experience the same results as Depakote.  The positive side effects of the Depakene: balanced mood, improved concentration, improved logical cognition, mental clarity, lessened anxiety and irritability, improved sleep, increase in pleasure about activities Depakene has a very thin coating, which caused severe heart burn and stomach upset.  The discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so I was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  This caused my mood to fluctuate again.  Even after I switched to the Depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  My appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  Certain foods that I normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when I ate them.  I did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because I was no longer stable anymore! Depakote was prescribed to me by a Kaiser psychiatrist in Pleasant Hill, CA in 2006.  The medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Type II.  My disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since I was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when I did see a professional, I did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  Anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: Prozac in 2001, which had minimal effect and I stopped taking them a few months later. Wellbutrin was prescribed again for ""chronic depression"" in the spring of 2006, but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  After the manic episode, I fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  I was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in June 2006 to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.  The symptoms I was experiencing before being prescribed the Depakote/Depakene: rapidly cycling mood swings between intense activation and irritablity/excitement and crashing lows and depression, suicidal thoughts, poor logic and decision making, racing thoughts, anxiety, poor concentration, and poor sleep.",Low
sarafem,10,"sarafem bi-polar / anxiety - It controlls my mood swings. It helps me think before i act or speak. It controlls amxiety. IT FREED ME TO LIVE MY LIFE HAPPILY!!! I cared about my life more.

It makes me a totally different person, a better person.",high
accutane,10,"accutane nodular acne - Within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  Sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  After one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  By the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed. Side effects included moderate to severe dry skin.  This condition was rectified by the topical application of ""Aquafore"" moisturizer. Drug was taken in gelatin tablet at 0.5 mg per day.  Drug treatment was carried out with bi-monthly visits to physician.  After 25 weeks ended treatment successfully finished treatment.  No recurrence of acne.",high
biaxin,2,"biaxin sinus infection - By the end of the 10-day treatment I felt better, but still had major congestion, green/yellow mucus and was coughing up mucus.  The symptoms were milder than before I started the treatment but definitely not gone. I felt no significant side effects - perhaps some slight drowsiness. Basically the treatment did not seem to work.  My presumption is that symptoms should have completely cleared up by the end of the 10-day treatment, but they were still significantly present.",Low

ultram-er,10,"ultram-er cervical disk degeneration and lower back pain - Ive been taking Tramadol for 2 weeks now. Ive been taking vicodin and percocuet for 7 months due to Cervial disk degeneration and lower back pain. I have to admit I loved taking Vicodin and percocuet. The problem is that they would knock me out. Tramadol has been awesome. It takes 90% of the pain away and I feel like I actually have energy again. From reading previous comments it sounds like I take a lower dose. Im really happy about that cause if I get use to it then I can up my dose and not feel worried about it. I have had no side effects so far. I hope it stays that way. Treating for neck, shoulder, arms, lower back, hip, thigh and knee pain.",high
klonopin,10,"klonopin panic disorder - I immediately stopped having panic attacks.  It really was miraculous, as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  On the combination of klonopin and prozac, I have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years. I simply feel ""normal"", and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness, which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  No longer did I have to leave work early, avoid restaurants and supermarkets, or worry about getting suddenly ""sick"", for no reason. I experienced no side effects.  I was not tired nor did I feel medicated. I started both klonopin and prozac together.  At first, I took klonopin 4 times a day.  Then gradually I was able to cut back to twice a day, first thing in the morning and again at dinnertime.  I did this very gradually, cutting out first the noontime dosage, and then the bedtime one.  I have never had talk-therapy at all.  I continue to take klonopin, or the generic clonazapam to this day with no adverse reactions at all.",high
effexor,1,"effexor depression - the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit, ie less suicidal, apathetic, morbid, depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help, hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors. here we go.the initial effect would be dry mouth and sleepiness, not being able to think straight or function really but once the dose would be acclimatised it would be okay. but it also cased both hypo and hypersomnia. shakiness at times. large cognitive deficits in reading and comprehension (eyes would literally\ physically play tricks not seeing words or substituting others, blind spots)and a general confusion not knowing what i was doing where i was going.nightmares, nightsweats family doctor initially prescribed wellbutin but a psychologist at the hospital suggested effexor. the dose would be increased as i would adjust and experience setbacks. the gabapentin was added when i had sleep troubles and to augment. many things were also added and subtracted to no avail. a psychiatrist felt the dose could be increased to 375 mg. so it was but i was not under any supervised care other than my family physician. all the above side effects caused me to be sent from specialist to specialist who all had tentative diagnoses ranging from borderline personality, narcolepsy (the modifinil), sleep apnea and restless leg, and finally bi polar. finally a different psychiatrist said it was the drugs!",Low

valtrex,9,"valtrex cold sores - Significantly diminished the symptoms and size of the cold sore.  Often, it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two, without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  For my body, Valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either Famvir, or Zoviraz.   It is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores, or are not aware of any new treatments after Zovirax. Slight dizziness and tiredness, very minor. 2x 1000mg tablets every 12 hours for 1 day.",high
provigil,6,"provigil chronic fatigue - Treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. I did not respond to 100mg a day as I or the doctor had hoped. But it did allow me to stay focused throughout the day with out drowsiness or fatigue, so I give it a positive review. Treatment effectiveness varies among individuals nervousness, insomnia (if taken late in the day) Took 100mg each day in the morning, sometimes if drowsy another 100mg mid-day

maxalt,10,"maxalt migraine - Very quick migraine relief with no nausea or drowsiness. Other medications (such as Imitrex and Relpax) had little to no effect, or took a minimum of 1 to 2 hours for relief to begin. 

I really like the dissolving tablet, as I can take it anytime without having to find a water fountain or other beverage. Relief is very quick, generally within 20 to 30 minutes. Very mild ""buzz."" This is the first migraine medicine I've found to provide quick relief without unacceptable side effects of previous medications (nausea, severe drowsiness).",high
xanax,5,xanax anxiety - The xanax would act as a downer. It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body. As I explained above. Addiction and drowsiness. Your mind and body felt like you were missing something. Until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. You would no longer dwell on the anxiety. Once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose I would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.,high
chantix,5,"chantix stop smoking - The benefits were to eventually stop smoking. At first I experienced a slight headache and upset stomache. I was to take 1 small dosage pill twice a day for 1 week.  Then increase the pill to the regular dose gradually after that week.  The medication is suppose to stop you from wanting to smoke basically by making you sick to your stomache when you smoke. During the first week you can smoke, but the second week you have to stop.",high

I have taken this medicine once daily, in the morning for at least 5 years.  It has been very helpful and does not make me sleepy.  It does not, however, last the 24 hours claimed, which is why I also take benadryl at night to manage allergy symptoms at night.",high
methotrexate,3,methotrexate psoraitic arthritis - the treatment masked the psoriasis and what was considered arthritis increasing all over body pain I started with 4 tabs and increased to 6 as the all over body pain increased and then they were going to put me on prednisone.  I opted to turn to homeopathic treatment and weaned off the methotrexate.  The all over body pain went completely away but the psoriasis was exacerbated.

One sister fractured her pelvic bone at 40 from bone loss. I had no side effects. I always followed the directions - take it with water. No other foods or drinks for an hour afterward. Don't ly down. I took the drug weekly for about 8 years. During that time I have had 3 bone scans. My bone loss subsided. I also drink a lot of diet soda though, and that can effect calcium intake.

First few weeks the medicine did not seem to work for me but my doctor increased the dosage to 20mg twice a day, then that was the time I started to feel my heart rate slow down. The medicine is definitely effective but I guess the effect of it depends on the individual as it requres a certain dosage for it to work effectively. I started feeling dizzy whenever I get up from sitting position to standing. I have informed my doctor about this and I was informed that this is a possible side effect of the drug. Details as above.",high

lovenox,10,"lovenox blood thinning/ circulation during pregnancy - Lovenox is given in subsequent pregnancies to women with recurrent miscarriage due to autoimmune issues.  Prior to taking Lovenox, I had two second trimester losses and thanks to Lovenox I was able to carry my two daughters to term.  It allowed my placenta to last the pregnancy without clotting and I was able to successfully have two children. There are no major side effects.  There is an increased risk of bleeding but I did not experience this.  The only mild side effects was burning at the site of the injection when the medicine was going in, and some bruising at the site of the injection. Other than this I did not experience any sorts of side effects what so ever. I had to self administer the shots twice a day.  Lovenox shots are primarily given on the belly.   However, the area usually remains sensitive and for anyone taking the drug for a prolonged period of time like I was, eventually you will run out of spots in your abdominal area and have to move to the thigh (I had to move to the thigh area during my last month of pregnancy). Other than slight burning and bruising, there was no other issues.  Initially I had a hard time giving myself the shot, and my husband had to do it, but once you get used to it, it's not really that bad and I was able to do it easily later on.  I was supposed to start the shots prior to conception and continue them six weeks postpartum.  My overall experience with Lovenox is very good and I am very happy that this drug was around to help me.",high

Have not been able to increase further because the side effects are so detrimental.  I am weaning myself off Lexapro now and beginning Celexa again.  I had a better experience on 20 mg of Celexa and it is far less expensive (because there is a generic).",Low
renova,5,"renova wrinkles - The treatmeant benifits are that I showed a slight decrease in wrinkles. I really think that if used with other products it could be better. I also used sunscreen everyday. I really didn't see a difference in the sagging of the skin . I thought it would help with collagen production. I am continuing to use the product. I hope I see a difference. The side effects are dry skin. I can't wax my eyebrows without having the skin peeled off. I know they say to stop 3 days before you wax but it doesn't help. Also, living in florida, my skin became very sensitive to the sunlight. I also get a slight tingling when I apply my sunblock or lotion. I went to my doctor and asked for a wrinkle treatment. He give me some samples of the creame. He then wrote me out a year prescription of the creame. He told me to apply it twice a day but, if my skin becomes dry, to reduce it to one a day. I preceeded to do that and it stopped some of the dryness.",high

I realize that each of us have different tolerances to various substances, and after my GP changed the medication to 30mg daily of Cymbalta my condition started to improve, but relapsed after about 3 weeks. The assumption was that I had required the higher dose of 60mg daily, and since taking 60mg daily my condition has improved to be close to my normal happy self with interests in various things. My advice is to find the medication that 'agrees' with you and stick with it for at least 1 month. Dry mouth. Constipation. Chewing gum to relieve dry mouth. Eating at least 8 prunes daily for constipation",high

strattera,8,"strattera bipolar - The treatment helped the patient focus on her daily tasks and enabled her to 'get going' in the morning.  In turn, the patient was able to exercise daily which also helped her maintain concentration throughout the day.  Daily exercise also helped her maintain her moods at a stable level. At first the patient took the medication before she went to bed, which kept her awake at night and did not allow her to sleep.  After a couple of week with inadequate sleep, she sought help and the doctor prescribed her sleeping medication, Ativan.  It turned out that the poor sleep was due to taking the medication improperly.  When that was corrected, the patient was able to sleep again and was able to function at a high rate. The patient is being treated for bipolar I disorder, with the most recent episode severe depression.   Being bipolar, she is not able to take anti-depressants as this may induce mania.  Therefore strattera is an effective alternative which enables the patient to function at a higher level thus treating some forms of depression.  Other drugs are taken in combination with strattera to help the patient function at an optimal level each day.",high

Blood pressure medicine has a mild diaretic which causes frequent urination. Also some drowiness noticed so I take this at night before bed. Thyoid medicine really does not have any side affects for me. Tolerated well. I take low dose of Prempro each day in the morning. No problems and tolerated well.

zithromax,6,"zithromax bronchitis infectiion - Infection cleared up but the cough did not. The Bronchitis returned and is still present. The Z pack was used on 2 seperate occasions but after the cough mucus was back to a clear color, my physician said I was fine. It is 3 weeks later and I still have Bronchitis and although my coughing is better it certainly is not gone. The side effects were stomach cramps and diarrhea for 2 weeks. I also took yogurt but that did not seem to help much. The cramps came within 48 hours of the first dose. It was easy to take but as i cramped so much I am really wondering if I did not take the Z pack would I have been in the same place as I am now without the heavy antibiotics. My physician said that I should rest, keep the house at 65 ' and drink warm drinks. I was very sick with not being able to sleep, coughing as if my chest bones would crack open and without sleep the days were very difficult.

kapidex,8,"kapidex reflux - stops persistent coughs in 30 days. non I tend to have persistent coughs after a cold, the coughs would last up to 8 months. I had been prescribed many cough medicine to treat the coughs, but nothing seen to work. This condition would occur winter after winter after a winter cold. Only two years ago my GI doctor diagnozed my condition as associated with reflux, and prescribed Kapidex for me to take at the onset of a cough. It works great because it stops my coughs after one month instead of up to 8 months.",high
symbyax,8,"symbyax bipolar disorder - The benefits were great. I really liked Symbyax because it didn't give me side effects like the other medication I used to take did. I would wake up in the day feeling refreshed. As I was taking Seroquil for my Schitzophrenia, I would always wake up feeling exhausted and tired;still, even though I would take the medicine during the nights! I used to be stressed and aggravated all the time before Symbyax and Seroquil. Now that I'm on Symbyax, I'm emotionally numb and the voices in my head vanished. So I had a good nights sleep and didn't wake up as tired as Seroquil used to make me. :] I didn't really have many side effects besides the medicine making me want to go to sleep. But I'm not complaining, since it does help the voices and the shadows go away for a while. Besides that, my psychiatrist wanted me to take advantage of the other side effect, and that side effect is that Symbyax might make you gain a little weight. So I wouldn't suggest it to people who want to lose weight. I still didn't seen any change in the weight gain and it was about a month when I started taking the lowest dose of Symbyax. Now that that month is over, I just started taking a higher dosage and I have noticed an increase in my appetite. I recommend this drug for the depressed ones who are a little underweight and the Schitzophrenics. As I was being diagnosed for my Bipolar disorder, I would say the medication did more for me than my therapist. The drug, Symbyax, made me more calm than I have ever been. It took about a week for the medicine to kick in and when it did, it really did work its magic even though Seroquil was pretty good at knocking me out to sleep, it didn't help me with my anxiety and depression like Symbyax has.",high

meridia,10,"meridia obesity - Dramatic loss of weight and inches first week.  Settled into Meridia's Program provided over the Internet (comes with perscription).  Promised myself to follow the rules.  The toughest for me, was not to weigh myself everyday.  Meridia wanted me to check only once a week and I'm glad I refrained.  The thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  The strength of Meridia has never lessened.  If I forget to take it, I feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and I am in free fall.  It really is strange...  When I take it with my vitamins each morning, it gives me a definite feeling of support.  I am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  I'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because I have a gym in my home.  I walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  I also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries, shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  I do eat snacks.  A Starbucks coffee (also made at home), with 1/2 an energy bar... or, an orange.  Responsible eating.  I also understand the dynamics of over eating, being menopausal with depleated hormones.  Meridia has been a life saver for me.  Thanks to my fabulous Doctor, who is also using it. In 2 mo. (3/4 of the program), 22 lbs weight loss. 3 months, 1 capsule of 10 mg. per day.  After 3 mo., back in to see my Doctor for another check-up.  Continuing on Meridia for another 3 months for achievement of goal.  According to my Doctor, I can use it as a maintenance.

I also slept soundly. It lifted my mood dramatically, but never made me manic. I also felt more like being with people and noticed that I was no longer so preoccupied with myself or awkwardly self-consciousness. In short, I wasn't depressed and anxious anymore! I gained about 5 lbs, which was not a problem for me since I'm slender to begin with. There was also some mild constipation, well not really constipation, but a decrease in the number of daily bowel movements. To offset that, I just drank more water. Not a big deal. I used this drug after trying Wellbutrin, which made me too restless and hyper. It was proscribed by a psychiatrist, who was very well versed in pharmacology, for a depression that came about during menopause. I took it regularly for three years; it completely stopped negative thinking and enabled me to sleep deeply for the first time in several years. I had regular liver check-ups, but never had any decrease in correct liver functioning.

Previously on Metoprolol tartrate and later Metoprolol succinate (both varying doses) and experienced severe dizziness/light-headedness, heavy-chested, and shortness of breath. Also experienced severe exercise intolerance. These symptoms remain when switched to Atenolol, but at much less severe levels. On Atenolol, also experience short-term memory loss, vertigo, constipation, indigestion. After diagnosed with tachycardia, prescribed metoprolol tartrate at varying doses over course of a few months (lowest dose possible was not high enough to keep heart rate low and next highest dose possible was too high, i.e, produced extreme shortness of breath/tight and heavy chest/dizziness. On the positive side, the medicine did slow heart rate and reduced episodes of extremely high heart rate. Next, prescribed metoprolol succinate with similar benefits and side effects. On both meds, side effects were too severe to function day to day. So I was put on Atenolol, and it has worked for me much better. Heart rate is held at a safe rate, and is more consistent than when on the metoprolol. Symptoms of dizziness, heavy chestedness, etc. are still present but highly diminished (I can at least perform normal daily functions now). Now I have additional symptoms of vertigo after elevator rides, indigestion, constipation, and short term memory loss (but nothing that I can't function with).

neurontin,9,"neurontin pain relief - After suffering a spinal cord injury in 1987 resulting in quadriplegia (C5/C6 complete), I experienced disassociated pain that was concentrated in my right thumb.  The problem got increasingly worse over the following years.  I ended up having to take a lot of ibuprofen and Vicodin, just to relieve the pain announce to allow me to get some work done.  However, the resulting side effects caused me to sleep a lot.  It also lead to depression.  I was finally given a prescription for gabapentin to try out.  It started working almost immediately.  After about two weeks I was rarely having the pain in my thumb anymore.  It doesn't cause me to get sleepy or feel drugged (like the Vicodin) so I have been able to work and concentrate on things once again.  It also seems to have helped with my depression, although that may have more to do with not having to deal with the pain, or the side effects of the pain relievers I was taking before. I have noticed very little side effects at all.  I was told it may affect the effectiveness of other pain relievers, but so far I have not noticed that -- when I needed to take a Vicodin when my thumb did still hurt on occasion.  I have on rare occasions noticed some dizziness, although I am not sure I can attribute that to the drug (I have low blood pressure because of my spinal cord injury that can sometimes cause that to happen as well). I take the medication three times a day as prescribed, drinking at least a cup of water with each dose.  I was originally taking a smaller dose of the gabapentin, but after about six months my thumb pain started to become more frequent again.  However, my doctor prescribe me a higher dose and that helped.  I do still have problems with the pain from time to time, but not at all like I used to.  All in all the drug has made a huge difference in my life thus far.",high

I suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  Since taking Lamictal at 300mg for 4 months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  I have not purged in 3 months.  This is amazing.  I would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  Now I feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, I eat when I am hungry, stop when satiated.  I have lost a LOT of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  I love the Lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  I am just a normal person now!  

I also quit the Lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  The Lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesn't numb the depression like the SSRIs I have been on.  I feel things.  I am clear-headed.  But I am able to step back and not be hurt by every look I get from people, I am not paranoid anymore, I can wake up in the morning with energy and I fall asleep within 3 minutes of hitting the pillow.  I get sleepy at 10pm.  I am not hyper and can sit still for more than 2 minutes.  :-)

All good for me.  This is the right medication for me... Loss of weight, but this was just a result of my mood stabilization as I had developed serious eating disorders. I started slowly and built up as recommended.  I have been very faithful and have not missed 1 dose in the 4 months on this medication.  I am now at 150mg 2x per day.

However, it is metabolized very quickly and only stays effective for about 3 to 4 hours.  Forgetting to take the second dose around 1:00pm makes for a confusing afternoon, until I remember to take it. My prescriber and I went through about 3 different medications before Adderall, and those did have unpleasant side effects such as sweaty palms (all the time), dizziness, and heart palpitations.

lamotrigine,1,"lamotrigine bipolar disorder - I felt better for the first few days, mood-wise.  But then I got depressed again.  So I guess that's not a benefit. I've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - I have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  When I was told that lamotrigine (the first drug I've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, I decided that this time, I was going to try not to worry.  One out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and I tried to be rational - that means I'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

Oh, was I ever wrong.

Firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  I wanted to die for two days more badly than I ever had in my life on this drug. It was excruciating.  Luckily, I have a lot of support, and I (obviously) didn't kill myself.

I couldn't sleep.  I lay awake most nights until 7am.  I eventually passed out and got maybe 4-6 hours of sleep.  This is barely better than the sleep I get when I'm hypomanic.  And we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  Luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  I also had to pee ALL THE TIME, which was not fun.

That brings me to the rash.
I first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  I thought it would go away, that I shouldn't freak out - I wasn't going to get the rash, right?  And the next morning, I was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  I went to the clinic, and the doctor said I was having an allergic reaction.  He told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  He knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  It got worse, and by night-time I was freaked out.  I called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  I did, and they had me stay the night to make sure I didn't have Steven Johnson Syndrome.  Luckily, I don't.  I just have something called ""drug eruption.""

Even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  I still am and it's been three days.  I'm afraid to go to the Starbucks around the corner.  My verdict?  Lamictal isn't worth it.  Don't risk it. I was put on 12.5mg, then 25mg, and we were going to keep raising the dose slowly to minimize risk.",Low

My son became a little whiney in the evening when the medication started to wear off. I have always known that my son had ADHD, evan as a baby.  I started looking into medication last year.  My son was in 1st grade and had already been suspended from school 3 times.  He also was in the principals office at least 3 times a week.  He was not able to sit still or focus and was having trouble making friends because of his temper.  My husband was against medication, but I talked him into a non-stimulant. We tried Intuniv first, but, that dropped his blood pressure to a dangerous level. Then we found Strattera, our miracle drug.  Within a week we noticed a HUGE difference.  My sons outburst of rage had completely stopped.  This year he hasnt been to the principals office once and his grades are mostly A's with a few B's.  He has also become very popular this year and is invited to almost every Birthday party. I cant tell you how hard it is to see every child in the class invited to birthday parties except your son.  The best part is he is still himself.  The medication doesnt make him groggy or zombie like.  I dont know what we would have done without this drug.  The only side effect we noticed was that he would get a little more whiney than usual in the evening, when the medication was wearing off.  Other than that, we havent noticed any other side effects.

I was prescribed a mild dose (10mg) of celexa by my doctor. At the time, (being a teenager) I was frequently tired anyway. I think this is why I did not notice the side effect at first.

After that, I tried a few other drugs like lexipro (which gave me the same side effects), and Wellbutrin (which made me feel manic, highly anxious and stressed). I had tried the Wellbutrin because I was told it would not make me sleepy. Unfortunately, in increased my anxiety to the extreme.

My face and chest both became very red, and my face especially got so bad it looked like hamburger meat.  My chest had many small red spots.  One area under my eye blistered and then became infected.  I did not even want to see sunlight, I became so sun sensitive.

ambien-cr,10,ambien-cr sleeping - I was able to stay successfully fall asleep and stay asleep the entire night.  I typically take 1-2 hours to fall asleep.

zovirax,10,"zovirax cold sores - Doctor prescribed Acyclovir for cold sores and said it would reduce duration of cold sores. In fact, it has completely eliminated flare ups for over 5 years. Before I started taking it, I would get a cold sore once or twice a year. It is very important to have a dose available at all times, because it is crucial to start taking it at the first sign of tingling. The effectiveness of this drug has far exceeded my expectations. None. At the first sign of a cold sore flare up, such as tingling, puffiness, or pain at the location were the cold sore normally flares up, you begin the treatment. My doctor prescribed 400mg 3 times a day for 5 days. 
It is very important to begin treatment immediately. Hours can make a difference, once the blister has formed, its probably too late and you will have to go through the scabbing and healing process. However, I have found that if treatment is started immediately at first sign of tingling, the blister is prevented altogether. At least, that is my personal experience.",high
flagyl,6,"flagyl stomach bacteria - The drug was used for removal of harmful stomach bacteria; it was a strong course of drugs but effective. I had a blackened tongue, the drug seemed to affect kidney / liver function, creating grey skin appearance and lethargy over course of medication.  Did not mix with alcohol. The drug taken for ten days in conjunction with antibiotic course, to treat multiple stomach ailments.  The pills were large, but taken singly, so the treatment was easy to follow.",high

I decided that I couldn't let it control my life anymore, so I talked to my doctor and he prescribed me clonazepam. This drug is very dependable and works fast. Whenever I feel anxiety coming on I will take 1 or 2 pills and I'm fine. It makes me sleepy, but it's definitely worth it. I'd rather feel tired than have a panic attack As needed",high

I was actually able to go to work with a migraine instead to taking a day off to just lie still. no side effects. At the first symptoms of a migraine I wojld pop a copule of tablets. For severe migraines I would repeat the dosage about 8 hours later. However, over time I found the medication to be less effective and ultimately stopped taking it.

I have taken fluticasone before, but it seems to be the addition of salmeterol that is the key for keeping my asthma under control. I have not experienced any treatment side effects.  I do have to rinse my mouth out after each dose to prevent oral yeast infection. Each diskus has 60 chambers each containing a dose of medicine.  Dial to the next chamber, open it, put your mouth over the chamber hole and inhale.  I hold it in my lungs as long as I can then breathe out and rinse out my mouth.

depo-provera,4,"depo-provera preventing pregnancy - In one year, I only had two periods. My periods before Depo were 2-3 days and very light, on Depo they were longer and heavier. It is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. It was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me. The first side effect I noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. After this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I would just cry for no reason at all and I felt like I was going insane. Breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. While these side effects were severe to me, the worst is the huge concave I now have in my thigh. While I had a total of four injections, only one caused a huge dimple. It's really embarassing and extremely noticable and I'm not sure why it happened. The doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. This is when I got off Depo and switched to Seasonique... Hopefully, this will work out better. If you don't like receiving shots, this is definitely not the right method. It is a pretty large injection.  However, you only have to endure it four times a month and it's not painful.",Low
ortho-tri-cyclen,4,"ortho-tri-cyclen birth control/control of menstrual cycle - The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control, and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy, and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of. I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first, I had no idea what was causing them, but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect, and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness. The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill, other than complaints about weight gain, bloating and mild acne.",Low

It made me very, very tired, so I take it before bed and sleep wonderfully. With 40mg dosage - increased sweating, faintness, nearly passing out. I started with the 20mg dosage and it seemed to be working pretty well until about a month in when I had a bad anxiety attack.  After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.  The doctor advised me to drop back down to 20mg and then try to go back up to the 40mg.  Emotionally, I felt better after the 40mg, even after nearly fainting, but the side effects were very bad.",high
seasonique,5,"seasonique birth control - I thought the benefits would be one period every 3 months, pregnancy prevention, regulated periods. I also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. WRONG! Well I was quite leary about starting Seasonique, I was already taking Yaz and I loved it, but 4 periods a year why pass that up. From the moment I started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, I had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill, Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. Hope this helps. 1 pill every day for 12 weeks, then 1 week of period pills",high

differin,5,"differin acne - I can't really say that the benefits were incredibly impressive. The topical treatment was used along side of an antibiotic for a series of weeks.(4-6) The acne condition improved, but never completely. Eventually, after a couple more scattered, severe breakouts in the following years; the acne went away. The side effects were dry, tender, itchy skin. Lotion and Sunblock were very necessary.

I have always been depressed.  This flared up considerable when I was having trouble with endometrious.  I was just sick of myself.  Within a few days of taking Lexapro, I felt beeter and could make reliable decisions about things.  After my hysterectomy, I needed the meds to work with the HRT.

fosamax,4,"fosamax osteoporosis - in theory, my bones should have gotten stronger, as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every 18 months I first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if I had a brick for breakfast. So I tried the oral solution which, in fact, was better on the stomach but,still, not completely without side effects. Most of the days I took Fosamax I had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning. I took Fosamax for almost 4 years and after 2 bone density scans which showed no improvement  I decided to stop the treatment, against my doctor advice which was to take Fosamax for at least 5 years. I believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. It's a big business and I finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones, I believe it is called). I still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. Waiting for more research I am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. And to be at peace with myself...  Thanks!",Low

I took my first dose of 100 mg  at bedtime and woke up in morning feeling almost like a new person.Tremendous reduction in pain and spasms of leg with greater range of motion.   After a day or two i had to increase the dosage as the knee started to stiffen up again making walking and steps difficult. Side effects are sleeping very heavily and waking up beyond my usual time feeling a bit loopy. I am able to drive to work, but find it hard to verbalize during conversations and seem to be grasping for words at times, which is embarrassing in my field of work.i have also found myself to be quite unproductive at work,accomplishing anything seems to be a major chore. I have a 6 year history of ruptured discs cervical and lumbar with cord compression post MVA  resulting in leg spasms, fasciculations and strong diffuse leg ache with limited range of motion.also weakness of both extremities and numbness in big toe.

methadone,9,"methadone back pain - Methadone certainly took care of the back pain I was experiencing. It was better than the other pain meds I tried (vicodin, oxycontin, percocet). The methadone doesn't make me drowsy nor does it give me ""buzz"". The side effects is weight gain.  As it was explained to me, the methadone slows down your metabolism, hence the weight gain. I had scoliosis and also landed on my head in a dirt bike riding accident.I had back and neck surgery.

paxil,7,"paxil depression - Helped me to feel better.  Lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  I was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. Once I was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  Eventually with the combined therapy, I pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (For instance, I can't get up early, during the 5am, 6am hours and get to work on time like I use to.  In fact I'm late for everything now which is out of my character) Can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like I use to.  Otherwise day to day life is manageble as long as I obey my bodies new limitations.
I didn't gain weight or increase in appetite.  I struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat. This drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  When I turned my head left or right, I got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  This lasted for many months. I thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. My psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  I didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  This passed after some months.  I no longer get it.  I felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  I'd fall asleep anywhere.  I don't know if it was the depression, the paxil, lack of sleep, my body trying to heal from stress.  Sometimes I felt like I was living life from inside of a fish bowl (from sensory standpoint). I was chronically late to my job of 8 years for 2 years straight after suffering this nervous breakdown (due to spousal abuse).  Subsequently, I was fired.
When I miss doses of the paxil, especially 2 or more in a row, I feel like I did when I just started them.  I can barely get out of bed and function.  I'm super sleepy.  I feel drunk.  I'm dizzy.  I will literally go missing for 2 days.  It takes a few days of regular doses to get me back into my normal mode. Initially I was only prescriped paxil and xanax.  I took only these for a few months under my PMD.  Dose was increased from a lower one to 20mg as my depression and anxiety symptoms were still moderately severe, impairing my work performace and other quality of life.  Withing a few months I was referred to a psychiatrist for med mgmt. After less than 6 months, Wellbutrin was added to the cocktail at a dose of 150mg, then increased to 300mg XL once daily.  Ambien was also presccribed as my symptoms did not allow me to fall asleep.  Life greatly improved within the next 8 months to a year.  I weaned off the ambien and xanax completely.  Still take the paxil and wellbutrin at the same doses.  Also had counseling during all of this time.",high
nolvadex,7,"nolvadex breast cancer - The benefits of tamoxifen have been to be cancer free 2 years after my diagnosis. Hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits. Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months. However, I feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. The effexor helps. Dryness is still a problem but not as severe. Vaginal odor continues to be a concern. I was put on Tamoxifen for 5 years following my 9/05 breast cancer diagnosis. I started Tamoxifen 12/05. I started Zoloft 2 months later when I began having mood swings. Zoloft helped for a year then I felt my symptoms returning. I began Effexor at 75 mg and have been fine. My oncologist felt I am young and strong (age 46, exercise 4 times weekly, runner, martial artist) and that I should try to lower or end my Effexor. However, I didn't agree. I needed help with the mood swings and irritability. I can't lose my temper at work. I work with developmentally disabled adults. Losing my temper could be my job. I did try a natural regime of vitamins (B-12 and E) for several months but I felt no relief. Friends even told me about my mood. I went from depressed to angry in a flash. The 75 mg of Effexor is wonderful. My estrogen is blocked by the Tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel.",high

The night sugars dipped dangerously low so I discontinued my night injection of Lantus. I have lost my independence with the use of this drug and become homebound. After the diagnosis of PMR, I was instructed to take 10 mg. in the morning. Although the pain diminished, it was still high so dosage was increased to 15 mg. I repeatedly advise the rheumatolist of the breathing problems to no avail.

klonopin,1,"klonopin anxiety - None Impossible to stop taking; had to do a Librium switch to get off this drug. The withdrawal is horrid, and there are tons of people suffering because of this. I had post-partum anxiety/depression, and was misdiagnosed with Bipolar with a post-partum onset. The Klonopin was prescribed for anxiety; a long term anxiety reducer. I saw little to no benefit. I was later rediagnosed by another doctor who said I absolutely did not have Bipolar, and slowly took me off my meds (5 years ago), which I'd been taking for six years. All drugs were easy to get off slowly, with the exception of Klonopin, which was hideous. The only way to get this drug out of my system was to do a Klonopin/Librium switch...and the Librium was very easy to get off of, thank goodness!",Low

It really works and is a very safe inexpensive drug. I dream a little more. It is a FDA approved drug at 50 mg. for Drug dependent patients.  It has been used in the 3 to 4.5 mg doses for MS for about 10 years.  It has gained popularity in the past 5 years and is undergoing various double blind placebo testing at this time for MS, Crones Disease, Aids, and various other conditions.  It is extremely safe in the Lower doses such as 4.5 mg.  It is also called LDN, as an abbreviation for Low Dose Naltrexone.  Once I started taking it for a few days, my MS symptoms improved and according to my Neurologist, my progression has absolutely stopped.  I started taking it in 2000.",high
alprazolam,10,"alprazolam anxiety - About 14 years ago I started hyperventilating for no apparent reason.  I would wake up in the morning and within an hour I felt like I had to struggle to breath.  This would continue all day, every day.  After 5 years, I was prescribed alprazolam (the generic Xanax).  It worked almost immediately.  I still have some days that are worse than others, but it has been a lifesaver for me.  I take one when I get up and then 2 or 3 times again during the day as needed.  It stops the hyperventilating totally for the most part. The only side effect is a mild drowsiness.  I take a very small dose.  The highest I take at one time is .5 mg. I take one .25 mg pill within 1 hour of waking up.  I usually take the second one around noon and another before going to bed.  If my condition is worse for whatever reason, then I might take another one during the day, or one .5 mg in the evening.  Sometimes if I'm busy and I miss taking a dose, and I feel myself beginning to hyperventilate, I'll then take one.  It works fast.",high

seroquel-xr,8,"seroquel-xr bipolar ii - I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder in February of 2009. I found that my manic states led to very erratic and inconsistent behavior. I also found the depressive lows to be particularly difficult to manage.

In November 2009 I was prescribed SEROQUEL by a Urgent Care Physician. Immediately I found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. I did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. I then switched to SEROQUEL XR and found a much more successful experience. I was initially given 400mg SEROQUEL XR paired with 10mg LEXAPRO. While initially a good way to stop the mania, I found 400mg to be too much to function on. I decided to halve my SEROQUEL XR dose to 200mg continuing to take 10mg of LEXAPRO. This combo has been great and I am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. I do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. I try to offset this by ensuring that I receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. This year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that I have never quite experienced beforehand. I found that despite the great benefits mentally, the physical side effects are a fair trade. 

I was about 115 lbs when I started this drug 10 months ago. Today I way about 147lbs. That's definitely a 37 pound gain.

Additionally, I always prided myself on my enormous amount of energy. After taking this drug I am extremely lethargic in the hours after taking it (bedtime) and the morning hours. I take 200mg of SEROQUEL XR and 10mg of LEXAPRO nightly.",high

synthroid,8,"synthroid hashimoto's thyroiditis - Most importantly, my blood pressure went back down to normal when my heart rate rose to a more normal level. I was then taken off the topral and my blood pressure has remained at a good level. Additionally, my hair stopped falling out and wasn't as dry. Also, my skin improved. Before the medication, my skin was horribly dry and flaky. The changes did not take place overnight. I would say that it took about 3-4 months to see any improvement in my hair and skin. I really experienced very few side effects, if any.  Initially, they started me off on a very low dosage because they just thought it was simply hypothyroidism but after a blood test, they realized that I has Hashimooto's thyroidities and moointored it more closely. At low dosages, there wasn't much improvement in my symptoms. I do have excessive sweating but they aren't sure if that is the synthroid or menopause and the doctors don't really seem concerned. Initially I was being treated for high blood pressure and put on topral but they did a TSH test and realized that something was wrong with my thyroid. I was originally started off on a very low dosage ( 12.5 mcg/daily) and had to keep going back for blood work every month. Slowly they increased it until they did another test and found out that it was Hashimoto's thyroiditis. At that point, they increased the dosage to 75 mcg/daily and so far it has worked out but I do have to keep having the TSH levels checked.",high
trazodone,9,"trazodone insomnia/poor sleep quality - Could fairly quickly fall asleep, and usually stay alseep, with little ""sleep hangover"" problem that most other medications result in. I could function in the morning. My general health started improving (fewer flues and colds, headaches, stress and depression, and I had much, much less pain as I started getting regular sleep. Some constipation, maybe dry mouth and eyes (not sure if there is a direct cause and effect, but definitely an overlap in timing). About three months ago I started waking up during the night (anywhere from 12:30 am to 3 am) without being able to go back to sleep. Have tried numerous other medications and they all had much, much worse side effects that trazodone. I'm not sure what you mean by this, I take trazodone nightly, and have taken it for at least two years. My worst experience from other sleep medications came from ambien (well before my doctor had even heard of the side effects I was having, nor were they listed on the medication or mentioned in the news). I also take cymbalta in conjunction with trazadone, which also supposedly helps you sleep, but the cymbalta alone is not effective for sleep at all for me.",high

finacea,9,"finacea acne and red marks from acne - It really helps keep my acne at bay - keeps pores clear and reduces frequency of inflamed pimples, reduces red marks from acne breakouts.  It is less drying/irritating than most other acne topicals. Slight itching for the first month or so. I was already pretty clear from going to an esthetician at an acne clinic, but I was just looking for an additional boost to the results I already had.  I previously discovered that I could not use anything other than very mild OTC retinoids, as they tended to make my acne flare up.  Finacea did not do this.  The Finacea was a good addition to my skin care regimen and has decreased the frequency of inflamed pimples and the tiny pustules I sometimes get around my nose.  Now I use Finacea in the morning, and Vivant's Derm A Gel in the evening, along with 5% benzoyl peroxide on my more acne prone areas (chin and jawline).",high

I didn't recognise this swelling as arthritis because it was my first attack, and I neglected to seek medical advice until the joint was extremely inflamed and swollen.  Since this attack, I've used the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen as needed to prevent further attacks. I experienced no adverse side effects when using Indomethacin with food as directed, and was very pleased with the almost immediate reduction in pain and swelling. My doctor prescribed one 25mg capsule 3 times a day with food, for one month, which I followed; this treatment was completely successful for me.

Now this I can describe: Lethargy - stared at the walls when awake, which wasn't often - most of the time I was passed out cold - even on Adderall; hideous nightmares - so horrible that I won't repeat them; constant sweating; incontinence; emotionally and physically numb; muscle twitches; rash on tongue. I don't know how to answer this question, except to say that I was prescribed Paxil 40 mg to be taken once a day because I couldn't stop crying over a grief issue.  It didn't work.  We switched to Wellbutrin, which was somewhat better and I took it for a year before stopping.

dexedrine,3,"dexedrine supposed adhd - With less Dexedrine and minimal Depekote, I was able to sleep deeply when I finally did fall asleep. I also remember extremely vivid dreams. The house was kept super clean and I was motivated to finish tasks. Horrible feeling. My heart felt like it would explode. I had horrible tic like behavior. I picked at my skin until permanently damaged. I had horrible dry mouth and I had bad breath. My sister was diagnosed with ADHD and so was my brother (Both were much younger 11 and 7 years younger) Both suffered from learning disabilities. I drove my sister to an appointment and due to my family history I was asked to take a questionair. I was then told that while I was not learning disabled (A Student), I was hyper and did I want to try the above drugs. They said I would never know how bad off I was until I knew what it felt like to be normal. I was given two perscriptions and was told to start with one dose of the dexedrine in the am and to take the Depekote and dexedrine in the afternoon. If that didn't do it they would up my dexedrine. With in about two months I felt like jumping from my skin and decided that organization was not that worth it. My skin still shows the scarring from all the picking and squeezing but my tone is no longer ""death warmed over"".
PS the doctor that prescribed this to me was investigated, tried and convicted of over prescribing, drug dealing and improper relationships with patients.

With Lexapro I remember having to wait a few weeks to get results, so I'm sure I'll wait. Doc says to wait, that's the treatment.

femara,3,"femara breast cancer - Aromatase inhibitor to reduce recurence of hormone-positive breast cancer- unknown effectiveness- no breast cancer 3 years after diagnosis Joint pain, reduction of bone mass The first drug I was prescribed after a mastectomy and chemotherapy was Tamoxifen, which I took for almost 1 year.  My oncologist said it increased bone mass, so she wanted to use that first to counteract the bone mass-decreasing side effect of the aromatase inhibitors.  Their protocol is to use Tamoxifen for 2 years, then switch to an aromatase inhibitor for 3 years. However, I had some uterine bleeding ( I am post-menopausal) so they switched to Femara early. Tamoxifen may cause an increase in uterine cancer, which my grandmother had. The most annoying side effect of Femara is the increase in joint pain.  NSAIDs and glucosamine help somewhat but have their own side effects.  That said, I am willing to continue Femara for the next 2 years to help prevent cancer reccurence.  I read in the literature (Medscape) that 51% of women do not complete their 5 yrs of either drug, and my guess is because of side effects. I take supplemental calcium also to slow the bone loss.",Low

There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes. It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also, my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly, not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall. I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.  I will have to continue the Retin-A for at least a year.",high

I took it for about a week with no decrease in this side effect. I stopped taking it for 2 days and noticed relief instantly. I then began taking it again and side effects returned. Vytorin was prescribed by my doctor for me for my high cholesterol. I took it for about a month and did not like the side effects. From the day that I began taking Vytorin I had diarrea. At first I thought it was purely coincidental until I stopped taking it for a few days. The side effects vanished. I took it again and they returned. I told my doctor about this and they switched me to Pravastatin ( same dosage) and the same side effects occurred. I then stopped taking the prescription.,Low

Having ended my marriage and gone through menopause I don't feel I can judge that aspect fairly.  However, I feel the Cymbalta is much more effective in keeping the dark cloud off my head, allowing me to be more positive toward life on a consistent basis. Dry mouth. I really notice when I miss just one dose; it takes 2 - 3 days to catch up, but then I become very aware of negative feelings and apathy.  I am careful to take the dose in the mornings so it doesn't affect my sleep, but have taken as late as 4pm and not had sleep issues.",high
propecia,7,"propecia hair loss - Slowed hair loss in front and top of scalp.  Regrew hair at the back of the scalp and on sides.  It doesn't appear that hair loss has ceased completely for MPB, but increased hair grow in another areas makes my head appear fuller Loss of limbido.  My case probably isn't a perfect control because I lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when I began taking the medication.  Within 4 months, started a brand new job and encountered other new stressors.  

I can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of 5 years.  I would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

I'm overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week, I only want it twice per month now.  Again, this is probably a plus I started slowing losing hair when I was 23-24.  The hair loss was unnoticeable until I turned 27.  My receding hairline started to become very apparent at 27, especially in my part line.  I began taking propecia when I turned 28 and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  

I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.  I may eventually go completely bald regardless, but I honestly feel I've saved 3-5 years of youthful appearance.",high

Slight increase in skin sensitivity, with stinging and mild redness experienced only after washing, and occasional slight flaking around mouth and eye areas. Increased sensitivity to UV light, necessitating daily use of high PPD sunscreen. I started applying a pea-sized amount of the Retin-A cream on every second night about one hour after washing. After two weeks, because there were no adverse effects for me I started using the cream nightly. With nightly usage I experienced very slight side-effects of sensitivity, slight redness after washing and occasional slight flaking. None of these effects were severe so I continued with nightly treatment. After approximately one month I experienced gradual lessening in severity and frequency of comedonic acne. Comedones still formed, but were less likely to become inflamed/infected. Slight reduction in surface oiliness noted. After about 10 weeks I noted a slight improvement in sundamage and skin texture.

desyrel,9,"desyrel insomnia - It helped enormously with sleep and gave me quite vivid dreams upon occasion.  I felt more relaxed in general and overall, quite happy - in fact, slightly euphoric ( it is a mild antidepressant).  I was able to sleep at least eight hours and waking, I was alert and not sluggish. I felt a little unmotivated during the aftgernoons.  Mornings, I was quite peppy but afternoon arrived and I felt sleepy, which is not normal for me.  I also had headaches upon waking up and  felt a bit unfocused.  But overall, it was great! I started with 25 mg a night, taken right before I wanted to fall asleep.  This worked off and one but not always for my insomnia.  I increased the dosage to 50 mg, which was highly effective.

dispermox,10,"dispermox tooth abscess - The abscess cleared totally after taking the stated dose for 4 days.  The full 7 day course was however taken. There were no noticeable side effects. The doctor advised taking 2 tablets for the first dose to 'kick start' it into my system, which I did.  After 4 days of the treatment, the swelling and the pain had almost gone.  I was then able to attend a dentist who could examine and treat the tooth that caused the abscess.",high
antivert,5,antivert b.p.p.v. (benign proxysmal positional vertigo) - It helped with the dizziness only because it made me so sleepy I couldn't stay up to notice the dizziness! Sometimes it would make my heart race so fast I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. This happened about 1 out of ever 5 times I took it. It had sedative effects so it just made me want to sleep. It wouldn't have been good for me at treating my dizzy spells while I was at work or in the middle of running errands because I would get much too tired to function safely.,high
meridia,6,"meridia weight loss - This drug initially provided a modest suppression of appetite. However, within one week my appetite was as great as ever. Given that this medication is not covered by insurance, its virtual ineffectiveness is particularly noteworthy. none Patient is supposed to take it first thing in the morning so that its time release qualites have the longest impact. One is told that after a month or so you may need to boost your dosage to continue to experience benefits. However, for me, the benefit lasted only 1 week! Not worth it!",high

I do not experience side effects IF I practice these other habits:  not drink any coffee after 10 am; I have to take the drug between 9:30 and 10:15 pm and go to sleep then.  If I take the drug after 10:30pm, I will be woozy and drugged the next day.  If I have to stay up later for any reason, then I can't take the drug and therefore will have insomnia and interrupted sleep. Take 150 mg at bedtime and go to sleep immediately thereafter.",high
zyban,10,"zyban smoking - After smoking for 41 years, I no longer smoke and can't believe I ever did. ZERO side effects. I held on to the prescription for 18 months, but never filled it - until I decided I should, completely expecting to fail.  I did as prescribed and continued to smoke through the first week or so.  One night I saw only six cigarettes left. I became anxious and actually went out and BOUGHT TWO PACKS! Leaving the store, I felt like a junkie who just scored a fix, and, I was disgusted.  But - I smoked them, finishing the two packs in a bit over a week, which was much less smoking than I had ever done.  ..And,.. after smoking the last remaining cigarette, I magically never smoked again.  

It's been over a year and I can almost qualify as one who has no cravings because they are so, so rare (maybe once every four or five months) and they last for less than a nano-second. 

I'm so smoke free and amazed at two things: 1. How easy it was to stop because of the Zyban, and, 2. That I ever smoked at all - even though I did for 41 years. Other than being smart enough to finally get the prescription filled, I deserve no credit because there has been no need for any great will on my part. I have absolutely no cravings, no desires, no urges to have to will myself through.  They simply don't happen.",high
lexapro,10,"lexapro depression/anxiety - Deppression disappeared. Anxiety disappeared. Since I have been on Lexapro I have realised I have been depressed most of my life. I have a very strong family history of major depression. I was in denial to the fact I was depressed. When you have always been depressed you don't know any different. Since Lexapro I have felt alot calmer and happier. The intense guilt I felt about everything has almost gone. My mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes I had made. I really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now I do. The depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. I am also becoming much less socially isolated, more confident and have began ejoying life. I would have liked to find Lexapro Many years ago. I started taking 5mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. When I increased to 10 mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. I also felt ""far away and fuzzzy headed"" for about 3 weeks. Insomnia was also an initial side effect. After 6 weeks I am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood. I began taking Lexapro for 6 weeks. I started at 5mg for two weeks and then increased it to 10mg. I plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better.",high
glucophage,10,"glucophage diabetes type 2 - Lowering of blood sugar without risk of hypoglycemia None For years I took 4 ml glimepiride daily for type 2 diabetes, but often awoke in the middle of the night due to hypoglycemia.  Finally my doctor reduced my glimepiride to 2 ml daily and added 250 ml metformin daily.  For me, this combination is very effective.  It controls my blood sugar as well as the glimepiride alone without the concomitant hypoglycemia.  I understand that some people with borderline type 2 diabetes control their sugar levels with metformin alone, and my doctor may try this if my glycohemoglobin blood tests (HbA1C) stay in the low 6s.",high
accutane,7,"accutane acne - The benefits were having clearer skin between month 2 and month 6.My skin did clear but i did still experience some smaller cystic breakouts, which was disappointing. the side effects were minimal and consisted of dry, cracked lips. Aquafor did help alleviate that situation. My mood was mildly affected. I did experience some mood swings from time to time. The other downside was having to go do the monthly bloodwork. Not having insurance and a tight schedule at work made it a little inconvenient and certainly expensive. Overall it was helpful but there is alot involved in being on the drug and the side effects are tolerable overall. I wish the benefits had a longer residual effect or there were some other long term treatments for cystic acne that were effective",high
xenical,6,"xenical obesity - Lost 8 kg during 6 months, which would have been more if eating healthier and exercising. Strong and first difficult to control bowel movements This drug makes your body to reject about 30% of fats that you intake with your meals. But you still get the rest of it.

Maybe if cut fats alltogether, wouldnt have needed Xenical.",high

pristiq,10,"pristiq depression - This is an NSRI, different from an SSRI because it works on more than one brain chemical. When an SSRI is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an NSRI. This was the case with me. I have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. Moving from one to the next as I bottomed out on each. Celexa and Lexapro being the most recent. When Lexapro let me down after a couple of years I was advised to try Pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. I was extremely hesitant as I did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness, headaches, possible weight gain, sexual issues, etc. You know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. So I chose to stay on my Lexapro and be depressed, hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. Wrong. Getting to the end of my rope with my depression I finally decided to bite the bullet and try the Prestiq. My depression disappeared within 3 weeks leaving me feeling better than I had in months. I began smiling again and fully functioning doing the things I enjoy and had let slide. My sense of well being and hopefulness for the future returned. Honestly, none for me. I sleep, did not gain an ounce, in fact I lost a small amount of weight even though I did not need to, no sexual side effect at all! Only thing that was tough was waiting for the dosage level to become theraputic in my system, which as I mentioned took about 3 weeks. I was instructed to continue on the Lexapro at a lower dose for one week. At the 2nd week add my dose of Pristiq to the lower dose of Lexapro, at the 3rd week drop the Lexapro completely and continue on my dose of Pristiq. This was done while staying in contact with my prescribing doctor. Now I take 1 50mg tablet everyday of Pristiq, and am doing very well.",high

It was so bad that I called my doctor and asked her to prescribe me something else.

She basically said she would normally only prescribe five days so with that I discontinued use. Feel better now but still have diarrhea. Been off for 1 day.

None - I felt no different at all I took the tapazole daily along with atenolol for the shaking and heart racing I was experiencing.  I am completely drug free for 9 months and the thyroid is fine.  I am so glad I didn't let the doctors irradiate the gland to ablate it.  I would have had to be on synthoid forever.,high
effexor-xr,7,"effexor-xr depression, social anxiety disorder - After a few months of treatment, I was actually able to function and get my social anxiety under control. My emotions became intact, and I enjoyed doing things again. Missing a dose of this medication is HORRIBLE. I start feeling withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours of not taking my medication. I once went 3 days without the 75mg pills, and I thought I was going to die. I was in a constant spin, I cried the whole time, I was exhausted, but I couldn't lay still. I was so nauseous that I couldn't eat and dry heaved for days. I literally thought I was going to die. DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF THIS MEDICATION!! In the beginning of treatment, I started out with 37.5mg pills and I did feel nauseous and dizzy for the first few days until my body adjusted, but it was nothing compared to how I would be feeling in 2 weeks! I do think this medication completely killed my sex drive. I don't have the urge to be intimate at all. I must say, I got extremely lucky with this medication. It was the first one I tried, and the only one I had to try. I was 19 when I starting taking this medication and was just starting my first year of college. I lived in an apartment with my boyfriend and attended school, no job. But that's all I did. Never made it out of the apartment, never went out, I lived in a huge city, made no friends, just an absolute mess. My emotions were a wreck and I felt absolutely helpless. I cried alll the time and I started having panic attacks out of nowhere, which I had absolutely NO idea what was going on. I just dealt with them in horror. I drank and did drugs, but it only made things worse. My doctor prescribed this drug and it did absolute wonders, within a week, I was starting to feel the weight being lifted off my shoulders. Within 3 weeks, I was able to drive in traffic, and open my blinds to let the sun in. Within 2 months, I was back to normal! I have the occasional off days, but who doesn't? The thought of possibly being dependent on this medication scares me because of how hard it's said to be weaned off of it, but I'm too scared to even TRY coming off effexor because of the withdrawal symptoms I experienced before. Overall, this medication is amazing, and does wonders.",high
xanax,9,"xanax anxiety - I was experiencing anxiety and would take a quarter of a pill to take the edge off.  Within 20-30 minutes the anxiety would decrease a lot.  Mostly I wouldn't even have a full pill in a day. If I took the recommended dose (half to a full pill) I would get very tired.  Once I tested different dosages and decreased it to a quarter, I cannot remember any side effects. The way it was prescribed I was to take up to one pill and I could take it every 4 hours.  That dosage was way to high for me so I decreased it to a quarter of a pill and only took it when I had extreme anxiety.  One bottle of 30 lasted me two years.  I almost never go to the doctor and I never really take drugs unless it is absolutely necessary.  I wanted to do your survey so I could get the free report on making home creams, but I also really like what you are doing!",high
clonazepam,9,"clonazepam anxiety/ panic attacks/ insomnia - The drug was taken for my daily anxiety caused by stress and also insomnia to help relax my body before bed. The drug is mainly intended for anxiety and works great at relieving those systems such as irregular heart beat, nervousness and other anxiety causing symptoms. I give it a 9 out of 10 for its performance. The only thing i didnt like about this drug is that with taking it overtime I felt as if my body built tolerance to the drug as well as became more dependent on it. I still am until this day and have managed to ween off the drug. Then again every ones body is different, Just do your research before taking benzodiazepines long term. The treatment overall treated my anxiety quickly and effectively. No regrets. The drug overall has treated me effectively despite the minor drawbacks.",high
amoxil,10,"amoxil sore throat with a low grade fever - My son is generally very leary of any type of medicine and even throws up certain cough syrups and acetaminophens that I would give him.  I had two concerns for this oral medication.  First, I was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  Also, being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick, I was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  I found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following, his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  Understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective, we continued to take it to the end of the ten days. My son did not notice/experience any side effects.  There did not seem to be any physical reaction with the drug except that he became better within days. I gave my son a teaspoon of amoxicillin after each of three meals per day for ten days in total.",high

nasonex,7,"nasonex congested sinuses - Traeatment with Nasonex was effective at controlling some of my congestion before sinus surgery and all of it after surgery.  The treatment also controlled my allergies to cats and dogs as a bonus!  I stayed 4 days at a freinds house with a dog and was without sneezing and stuffiness, however my asthma was still an issue. Immediate side effects that I noticed were with my immune system.  I got sick (colds and upper respiratory infections) more easily and I had one bug bite that became infected and took a long time to heal.  I also noticed that I put on a few pounds (2-3) but am not sure if that is related or not. Began treatment with spray before sinus surgery and continued after surgery.  6 months after surgery, the spray was stopped.",high
benicar-hct,1,"benicar-hct hypertension - Blood pressure was decreased initially to where it should have been, and gradually stopped being so effective Severe rectal pain, beginning around 4 weeks into the treatment. At first there was burning, after bowel movements, then increased to severe burning all the time, then to pain, and finally severe pain (could not sit or lay down). No hemorrhoids, tears, or fisures, but the pain continued, even if no bowel movements for days. Finally stopped taking the medication at the end of August 2009, but the symptoms continue even now (Feb 2010), although not nearly as bad. Now the pain just makes me sit sideways, but at least I can sit and lay down to sleep. I had never been diagnosed with high blood pressure, but had recently gained several pounds because of the double round of steroids I was put on because of a severe skin rash (seasonal allergic reaction). Since we had recently moved I didn't have a PCP yet and the rash on my arms looked like it may have been getting infected, I went to a local emergent care center and saw a doctor there. They took my blood pressure and immediately put me on Benicar HCT, 20 mg, once a day. I took the medication as prescribed until the anal pain got to be too bad. Since going off the medication my BP is a little elevated but I'm reluctant to go back on any meds, especially no one seems to be willing to admit the Benicar caused this problem or is offering any solutions to help it get better.",Low

oxycontin,3,oxycontin back pain - It provided me Pain releif that enabled me to get up in the morning and pain releif that helped with cramps and pain while sleeping at night. I think it only blocked the pain receptor in my brain but didn't actually provide a cure for the main problem. It was like a mask that may have caused more damagae in the end I became severely addicted to the drug. With flu like symptoms when out of meds. I became dependant on the meds everyday to function and because it was working for enabling me to go about my day I didn't look for a proper treatment.

levaquin,1,"levaquin sinusitis - Although I took this drug about 3 to 4 days before I realized it was making me sicker, there were no treatment benefits during the time I was on it.  Actually , I started feel worse about day 3 or 4.  The drug seemed to be enhancing the sinusitus symptoms! The treatment side effects of Levaquin were very similar to my sinusitis symptoms, hence the fact I stayed on the drug for several days.  Side effects included headache, dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea (nausea is not a symptom of sinusitus that I ever experienced before).  The side effects slowly got worse the longer I took the drug. I asked for the drug in liquid form, as I have difficulty swallowing many pills.  I took the drug as recommended, but the symptoms did not get better.  As I mentioned earlier, the symptoms got worse.  I called my doctor's office on the third day and was told that the symptoms I was experiencing was the infection.  By day 5 I knew it was the drug, and stopped taking it.

I had been on so many different antidepressants I thought this was how my life was always going to be, my family slowly watching me sleep myself to death. Since my doctor put me on Effexor XR added Lamictal & Desyrel I feel better than ever. I also found out I'm allergic to wheat, dairy & eggs. Deleting these items from my diet along with the medications has made me a new person. The only adverse effect I experienced was when I tried to play doctor and wean myself from the meds. It was like withdrawals from hard drugs; chills, nausea, etc. I took periodically myself off my meds because I didn't want to be dependant on medicaton. It was always the wrong thing to do. My Dr gave me a sample pack (containing 7-37.5 mg capsules & 7-75mg capsules) as well as a  prescription for 75 mg. I was to take the 37.5 mg capsules then the 75 mg capsules.

topamax,8,"topamax migraine - The number of migraines were reduced from 20+ a month to 12 or even less.  There have been some months when I have had only 5 or less migraines.  More importantly, the intensity of the migraines is considerably reduced.  On a pain scale of 1-10, I would have 12 or 15+ pain, that no amount of medication helped, and they would last for 3 to 5 days.  Now, when I do get a migraine, it's usually at a 2 or 3 pain level, and I rarely need to take more than 1 Relpax for relief. One rather odd side effect, which others on the drug have commented upon, is that you forget words.  I've always been very articulate, and it can be frustrating to be in the middle of a conversation, or when I was doing training sessions, to suddenly go blank and be completely unable to remember a word I've used all my life.  Also, at one point I decided to go off the medication in the vain hope I could manage the migraines without drugs.  Even coming off the Topamax over a period of months, I gained 20 pounds. I started on the usual dosage of 25mg in the morning and evening, then after 2 weeks increased it to 50mg twice a day.  Most people stay at this level, however, I seem to have a very high metablisim when it comes to medication, and anything I've taken for migraines always has to be increased beyond normal dosage in order to work.  Therefore, my neurologist increased the dosage to 200 mg a day, and after about a year when that no longer worked, we went to 300mg a day, which I know is high for used in migraine treatment.

I found it slightly more difficult to drive while under the influence of the drug, and oftentimes I caught myself spacing out.  Sun exposure seemed to strengthen the drug's effect, and being in the sun made me lethargic and sometimes even dizzy.  Overall, I always felt as though I was on an irregular level of consciousness, and not in the same mental place as surrounding people not on the drug. I was told to take one or 1/2 tablet approximately 30 minutes before undergoing an event that I predicted would inflict anxiety.  My stress was effectively reduced during family meals and going out to restaurants.  However, I took 1/2 tablet before receiving a vaccination shot and, although I did not pass out as usual, I still became lightheaded and dizzy as a result of the needle.  Perhaps a whole tablet would have eliminated these effects.  In the end, I couldn't get used to feeling like I was on drugs while trying to work, drive, etc. so I decided to not refill my prescription and began seeing my therapist more often instead.",high
differin,9,"differin uneven skin colour, anti-aging - My skin has become dramatically clearer and it has a fresh glow that I am very happy with.  My skin is smoother, finer, and the darker areas on my forehead (related to sun exposure) have faded almost completely. Mild redness in the first three or four weeks, especially after exfoliating in the morning (which is my habit, not something recommended by my dermatologist though I have not asked).  It is a lot more urgent that I get moisturizer on after washing my face in the morning than it used to be before starting this treatment.  My face feels very tight and uncomfortable until I get the moisturizer on. Before the treatment, I had noticed my skin was becoming dull and a bit leathery, and some wrinkles were setting in to my forehead. This is all substantially improved, and I'm so glad I shelled out for this cream.",high
wellbutrin,9,"wellbutrin depression - My dosage is NOT the standard treatment of 300 mg daily, however at the 100 mg daily dose I get some benefits, including decreased irritability and appetite control, without side effects. None. I have been on this medication, at this dosage for a few years now, and it works great. No side effects at the 100 mg per day dose but I still get the benefits of help with mood swings and appetite control.",high

glucophage,8,"glucophage pcos/insulin resistance - I went to the doctor complain of never losing weight despite dieting and exercises, and after some medical evaluation , I was diagnosed with severe insulin resistance, polycysitc ovary syndrome , and hypothyroid ,all which contributed to weight problem  , my doctors plan was to take metformin at the maximum dose , 850 mg , 3 times and and to start a medication for my throid , within 3 months I had lost 20 pounds , normalized my periods and reversed my insulin resistance I was instructed to keep taking metformin  for the rest of my life gastric side effects I was instructed to tae the drug 3 times a day infintely",high
climara,5,"climara perimenopause - I began taking Climara for perimenopause issues-- insomnia, horrible PMS, moodiness, night sweats. It helped for these issues. The main side effects I experienced with Climara were bloating, weight gain and indigestion/gas. I gained 8 pounds in two months! As soon as I stopped the drug, the bloating and gas disappeared, and my weight gain is returning to normal. Climara is meant to be used with a complementary progesterone subscription. I took  it in pill form. Now I am planning to try Amberen, a natural supplement which is supposed to balance the endocrine system. Got my fingers crossed!",high
zocor,9,"zocor high cholerterol - lowered cholesterol by 13% with no side effects there were no side effects from the dosage I take One pill daily to reduce bad cholesterol with no side effects, I didn't really change my diet and the simvastatin reduced cholesterol by 13-15%. I get yearly blood test to see if it effected my liver and so far have had no problems.",high
synthroid,8,"synthroid hypothyroidism - Clearer thinking; improved outlook and energy level. I have had a persistent cough since taking this drug. Taken first thing with glass of water and no food for 30 minutes. Doctor did not see the connection between cough and Synthroid,(chest Xray came back fine) however as it did bother my stomach briefly at time of dosing, I decided it might be affecting the stomach lining. Recently towards late afternoon or before retiring will take Tagamet or some generic stomach med. I DO NOT experience heartburn, however, this routine seems to reduce the embarrassing cough significantly. This was my own resolution after trying many allergy medicines once or twice which did not stop the cough at all. Was also given sample of Advair which I did not use due to negative side effects I read about on internet before using. I am seeking a more natural and effective solution to replace the Synthroid with something that will treat source of low thyroid as well as the symptoms.",high
effexor,8,"effexor depression - stopped depression ie. repeatative negative thoughts, suicidal thougts, and general malaise.  relieved insomnia. Bizarre dreams on nightly basis.  Possibly digestive problems. I started on effexor after a serious suicide attempt following chronic sleep deprevation.  The trazadone was quickly added.  I effectively slept and within several weeks of taking both medications (taking the effexor and trazadone at bedtime) found my depression relieved.",high
tri-luma,10,"tri-luma melasma - excellent!!!! been using on and off for about 5 yrs now. I have learned how this works so theres no side effects such as really dry flaky skin. i use a little in the am then at night.I do this for about 2 wks. Meanwhile i DO NOT use any scrubs or rub my face , just gently, also NO masks or toners etc. Close to 2 wks, when in a hot shower gentle exfoliate, you will see dead skin coming off. dry your face and ts gonna look dry, flaky and terrible. use PURE COCOBUTTER on your face during the day, then only at night use the triluma, and repeat the exfoliate every few days, then the cocobutter etc, until you get results. My face looks amazing after using this process, but i do not have acne, so not sure how it would  work with the cocobutter, might make the acne worse.  good luck! dry skin explained above",high
citalopram,6,"citalopram depression/anxiety - I did not notice any benefit myself, although my wife felt I was less 'Snappy'. Hoping to get more benefits now I have moved up to a higher dose. Waking up in the night and not being able to sleep. Shaking. Nervousness. Agitation. Sweating. Increased sex drive. Upset stomach/ flatulance. Tiredness. Dejavous. I am writing this having just been back to the GP's as I did not think it was working as well as it could do according to other reports. He raised me up to 40mg from an initial dose of 20mg. 
As you can see I have listed a lot of side effects, although to be honest these were not a problem and mostly gone by 10days of treatment. That is until I got raised to 40mg and now they are back with a vengeance. 
However, if it helps with the depression it will be worth it. I have my tablet with food as otherwise I get a dodgy stomach, but for some people they may need to take it without food for the same reason. Again, if it makes you tired, take on an evening, if it keeps you awake then take on the morning.",high
benicar-hct,8,"benicar-hct high blood pressure - The benefits were that it did help lower my blood pressure. With the HCT added to the Benicar, I was constantly going to the bathroom.  My potassium got so low on this medication that I am currently taking 3 potassium pills daily. Benicar/HCT was taken once a day due to my blood pressure being high.  It did help control my blood pressure, if I ever forgot to take it I could feel the results - headache, etc.  When I first began taking it I felt really tired all the time but eventually got used to it.  I started losing weight (not because of the medication, I was actually trying to lose weight) and my potassium got so low that my physician took me off of the HCT part and started me just on the Benicar 40 mg daily.  I am still taking potassium pills until my labs show that my potassium is okay.",high
protopic,4,"protopic eczema - Got rid of eczema quickly when applied in a thin layer. I have used this for years without realizing its side effects or being told about the side effects from my doctors or pharmacist. This drug has severe side effects, and I was not told about ANY of them! I believe I have gotten shingles as a side effect from this drug. Shingles tends to happen to the elderly or people with weakened immune systems. My immune system was weakened by this drug enough to get shingles!  Do your research before continuing to choose to use this product. Applied whenever I had a flare-up with a thin layer of the Protopic ointment. 
Please educate yourself and try many other alternatives before even considering using this product. I have used it for many years and regret it after learning about all the harmful side effects.",Low
yasmin,3,"yasmin birth control - Less acne, more controlled cycle headaches, dizzy spells, extreme breast tenderness (like someone is crushing them), anxiety, slight depression, very bad cramps, very large clots, mood swings, heart palpitations Got on Yasmin to weaken my flow, my acne from the previous pill went away (ortho tri clyclen-lo), everything seemed great. I was slightly discouraged about my weight gain, a few pounds here and there, but 2 years later I am 40lbs heavier than I was when I started this pill. I do not solely blame the pill for this but I can imagine it has aided me in packing on the pounds. I exercise regularly and try to watch what I put in my mouth. I have random weird mood-swings that only seem to be getting worse. I stopped taking this pill the other day because I couldnt stand always being tired, fatigued, moody, and the headaches were unbearable. I have had a few since that day but hopefully everything will start to get better. I am looking for alternative pills because most of them make my acne really bad, and I have never had acne as a teenager. My mothers friends daughter was only on this pill 3 months and had liver problems. My health isnt worth it. I would rather bleed for 8-9 days than possibly die. Be careful ladies.",Low
zetia,9,"zetia high cholestrol - My target was to have the a cholestrol reduction from 240 to under 200. I did not want want to take statins because I am not comfortable with drugs that inhibit normal metabolic processes. Evolution is parsimonius, and inhibition of any enzyme is likely to be reflected as an adverse effect in a seemingly unrelated area. Also, I did not want to take red yeast rice, which basically is a non-phrmaceutical grade of a statin. I liked the physical mode of action of Zetia. Within 6 months of starting treatment, my total cholesterol was down from to 200 and my HDL went up from 45 to 58. I did not experience any perceptible side effects. See treatment benefits above. I take my daily dose of Zetia shortly after having my breakfast.",high
atacand,9,"atacand high blood pressure - The Atacand worked well for me IF taken consistently without skipping days.  I was able to bring my blood pressure to at least 120/80 and at times a bit lower.  Note that consistency of medication is a key.  Should the 8mg tablet taken once per day not prove as effective as desired, my physician advised that I could take an additional tablet or two per day without problem. Did not notice any undesirable side effects.  The only thing that could be mentioned is that if one embarks on a significant exercise routine such as elleptical stairstep machine for 30+ minutes/day and keeps up the exercise for weeks on end while at the same time taking the Atacand, one may end up with a [not undesirable] blood pressure in the 112/65 range. The Atacand worked well IF taken routinely without skipping days.  It takes a while for the regulation to start, ie, you can't begin from scratch taking the Atacand the first morning and expect proper blood pressure regulation that afternoon.  Doesn't work that quickly.  There is a tendency, after taking the medication consistently and seeing your pressure get well under control, to think that maybe you can stop or at least taper off of the Atacand.  One may try this but will find that the best regimen is consistency.  It did work well for me and keeps me under 120/80.",high
antivert,10,antivert labyrinthitis - Decreased the vertigo almost immediately; no further vomiting; I was able to walk and move my head without the awful spinning. Sedation--I almost the entire time I took the medication...I'm not sure I could have taken this and gone to work. My doctor said the Labyrinthitis is usually preceded by a cold and fluid collects in the inner portion of the ear and causes the dizziness/vomiting.  The treatment was symptom relief (using the Meclizine) and the fluid gradually absorbs.,high

So Istarted on paxal for 3 months .felt somewhat better but slowed down or groggy.I decided the side effects were counter productive to what I needed in an antidepressant. Iasked to try wellbutrin. And felt the above mentioned benefits. I stared on the extended release then switched to generic and 2x a day dosing as the generic was much cheaper.I felt no difference between name brand and generic. Ihad no weight loss side effect.",high
amoxil,8,"amoxil infection (in ear) - the treatment cleared up the infection, mostly.  It cleared up the infection but I still felt that it was there for a while.  It did get rid of the pain in my ears from the infection really quickly, and the 'blocked up' feeling I had in my ear. There were no side effects. The infection was mostly cleared up.  For a few weeks I felt as though I still had a bit of an infection or it was coming back.  But after a while that went away.",high

None I was taking benadryl prior to zyrtec. I found that benadryl was way too drowsy and zyrtec isn't. I take zyrtec in the morning and it alleviates my symptoms. My doctor said it was better to take it at night because it might cause drowsiness. I find it easier to take in the morning because I usually forget at night. I find it to be very effective in alleviating most symptoms.,high

desyrel,7,"desyrel depression - less depression and suicidal ideation. I was not responding to any other anti-depressants and this one sometimes works for people who do not respond to others. Maybe it's because it makes you sleep very well. Sometimes it is prescribed as a mild sleeping pill. sleepiness, it must be taken at bedtime. and some memory loss. a bit of blurred vision.

topamax,3,"topamax migraine - I first began taking Topamax when I was fifteen. I had severe migraines about five every week. When I started it did automatically begin helping me with the headaches, and then the side effects sat in very soon after. Yet, the weight loss side effect was the only positive. I lost twenty pounds. Within twenty minutes of taking Topamax I began to get tingles in my feet and bad in my hands. The next two weeks when they had moved my doze from 50mg to 100mg I felt like a dud in class. I couldn't remember anything that I would have been able to grasp so much more quickly before. I would stumble on my words and get so confused. On top of all this, I was constantly in a bad mood and depressed. I finally said enough was enough the day I got over heated at the lake, I got over heated because Topamax doesn't let you sweat. Overall, the side effects over ruled the relief. Above.",Low

lyrica,8,"lyrica chronic pain - The treatment quieted the nerve endings givig them a chance to calm down from the chronic pain cycle.  It allowed the nervous system to regulate itself properly again. In the begining of treatment she was nauseas, dizzy, light headed, spacey, these symptoms decreased with time. She still gets what we call ""lyrica head"" on cloudy days.  ""Lyrica head"" is a foggy feeling.  Other patients taking lyrica that we have spoken to complain of this also. She has suffered from chronic joint pain and several dilocated or sublaxed bones and joints through out her life.   About 18 months ago an orthopedic doctor treating her for another ligament injury looked at her history and saw a pattern and sent her to a geneticist who made a clinical diagnosis after doing some test.  She was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3. She was then referred to the pain clinic to get some help with the increasing pain from her condition.  Their she met an anastheologist who prescribed Lyrica.  She was started on a low dose and increased gradually and after some trial and error settled on 100 mg 2xday.  The higher dose made her too spacey and light headed.",high
duac,6,"duac acne - Acne outbreaks healed quicker than using no medication. At first my face was really red, dry, and flakey. After about 4 mos my face still gets red sometimes and is a little burny/itchy which it makes it hard to shave. When I started using Duac (at bedtime) it made my face red, dry, and it peeled.  A great back-to-school look! I play outdoor sports and know I am suppose to wear suncreen but now all suncreens make my face burn(sting) more so I can't tolerate sunscreen.  The slight sunburn is actually less painful.  My acne seemed to heal the first 1-2 weeks and then it flaired up. It still flares but less frequently with less spots and heals faster.  Biggest problem is that it's like bleach on my navy pillowcase and I have ruined a lot of dark colored towels",high

If I skipped a day, I would start to have severe gastric distress from acid reflux, would then have to take the Prilosec as well as an instant-acting Tums or Rolaids. If I took the pill and also several Tums or rolaids, I would get diarrhea. I worry about taking a pill for acid reflux because I read a study that says that this type of medication can also leach the calcium out of your system.

fluvoxamine,9,"fluvoxamine insomnia - I have suffered from insomnia off and on for a number of years.   Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant and, as I didn't feel depressed, I was a little dubious initially.  My GP suggested I try it as I was unwilling to take any sedative-type pills.  After the initial start-up period (around two weeks) I found it made a big difference.  I now go to bed and sleep normally without any side effects such as drowsiness.  My GP suggested that I might have had a level of depression which was affecting my sleep, I don't know, although I do feel better generally as well as sleeping well. In the first couple of weeks I felt a bit upset in my stomach, otherwise I was fine. I took 100mg  Fluvoxamine about an hour before bed each night.  I continue to take it nightly.",high

Anxiety continued to increase and the dementia progressed systematically.  Disorientation continued to increase and the patient became more and more difficult to manage.  It appeared that irritability increased and the patient became more agitated more easily. There was some indication that there was at least some increase nausa as well as some infrequent but increased bouts of diarrhea.  There were a few episodes of vomiting, but it might be attributed to other factors for this one side effect.  There was definitely increased insomnia as well as loss of appetite, but it can not be definitively stated that the drug alone contributed to these although it did occur after the drug was begun. The patient was given a daily dose.  After transfer to a care facility, the regimentation in taking the dose was firmly set in place.  Staff medical personnel on site did not observe any benefits, and as a result, after about 6 months the prescription was terminated. During the time the drug was used, there was a patient review every other week to ascertain whether there seemed to be any improvement in the patient.  Memory tests were administered and one-on-one interviews were executed by medical personnel.

Unfortunately this medication did not seem to help with the Fibromyalgia very much. It put a damper on my libido.  I wasn't much interested in having relations with my husband.  He was not too pleased with this.  I wasn't happy with this side effect either since it is not very good for a marital relationship. I was to take this medication once a day.

My doctor advised me that a follow-up dexa scan should be performed in two years to determine if the treatment is effective in reversing or at least arresting the osteopenia.  The drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer. I experienced some mild hot flashes during the month I took the drug.  These hot flashes were not of the intensity that I experienced when I first started to experience menopause.  I did have more ackiness in my bones and joints when I first starting taking it but these went away after the first few weeks. I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.  I took one 60 mg pill each morning with 600 mg Calcium with Vitamin D as directed by my doctor.  I also walk 30 minutes daily on my treadmill, again at my Dr.'s direction.  I refilled the presciption at a local discount ""member's only"" store and paid $106 for one month of the drug. I have since purchased the drug on line for about half the cost.  Once I receive it, I will resume taking the drug.  Looks like I'll have about a two week vacation.  Biggest concerns about taking this drug are blood clots and stroke.

wellbutrin-xl,10,"wellbutrin-xl depression/anxiety - I presented with General Anxiety Disorder and Aggitated Depression.  I was unfocused, angry, anxious and had racing thoughts.  Wellbutrin XL helped with depression, unfocused thinking and racing thoughts.  I was more focused during the day and was able to complete tasks.  It also helped so that I would not fly off the handle and it helped me stay out of bed.  In a nutshell, it helped me with energy.  A main help was with the sexual side effects of Lexapro, a seratonin reuptake inhibitor.  Lexapro would dimish my libido and make it difficult to reach orgasm.  Wellbutrin really helped to conteract these side effects and gave me even energy during the day. The only side effects from Wellbutrin is that sometimes I had difficulty getting to sleep if I took the dose later in the day (past noon). The treatment includes Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.  This is a time released tablet and delivers medication during the day.  In addition, I would take Lexapro 5 to 10 mg for the aggitation and racing thoughts.  This was really helpful with anger and outbursts.  If I had trouble sleeping I would take Trazadone 10 mg at night, and if I did not have it I would take Simply Sleep or Tylenol PM, but only one tablet.  Sometimes I would cut the Trazadone in half for a 5 mg dose.  I have had low grade anxiety and depression for many years.  I have been menopausal for 4 years.  I have a lot of stress in my life with two teenage boys and we live in a high end community outside D.C. with cut throat competition on every corner.",high
zomig,6,"zomig migraine - THe zomig nasal spray is generally very effective in curing migraine. 80% of the time the pain is 75% or more gone within an hour. Another 15% of the time it takes up to 2 hours.  5% of the time the pain is only lessen.  However lately some of the single dose units do not discharge the medication properly. Instead of a spray, you get a drop or two.  When this happens, the frequency of the pain not going away by at least 75% goes up. A couple of times it seemed virtually ineffective.  If the quality control doesn't improve, I may have to switch to a different Triptan. Generally I fell a little dull or numb in the head, very slightly dizzy. Rarely there is a little tightness in the chest. Since insurance only covers 2 per week and the doctor doesn't want me to take it too ofter for fear of rebound headaches, I generally wait until the headache is fairly bad and is interfering with my ability to work.  I will frequently take Tramadol, ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetophenamin earlier. These work maybe 25% of the time, or take the pain down enough so that I can avoid taking the tripan.",high
tazorac,8,"tazorac acne - The treatmen was very effective as it helped keep pores clean due to exfoliation. the acne deminished after regular use for around 3 weeks, although it seemed to increase at first. This was expected according to directions. the only side effects were a little irritability of the skin around the nose and eyes. Maybe because some product gets trapped in the deeper wirinkles in that area, so must be careful to distribute evenly. I am very delighted with the medecine, to the point where I feel addicted to it and don't ever want to go without it again. My skin feels much smoother, with almost no blemishes, except duting PMS times. I also feel like I look younger and healthier due to renuwed skin.",high
duac,6,"duac acne - decrease in frequency and severity of acne lesions. Blackheads were not as noticeable and pustules were much reduced in size and number. Benzoyl peroxide is a strong bleaching agent and ruined many bathtowels and pajamas and bedsheets and pillowcases. During the wintertime, this treatment was mildly irritating to dry or sensitive skin. During the summertime, perspiration tended to cause this product to run off the target area and bleach clothing around the collar or neckline. Some mild dryness and scaling At bedtime, wash face with mild cleanser. Apply duac gel (pea size), follow with anti-aging over-the-counter moisturizing cream. Wash again in the morning (or else the Duac will bleach clothing), follow with SPF 30 moisturizer, and makeup as needed. Acne lesions which are dry and crusty were treated with a dab of topical neosporin ointment to speed healing.",high
nexium,10,"nexium gerd - After I started taking the medicine at the proper time of day, I no longer had to sit up to sleep. No longer have acid backup into my throat or throw up. As long as I didnt eat especially fatty or rich foods after 9 pm I was able to have a good sleep. none take one pill every morning, do not eat fatty foods or rich foods especially later in the day. Important to take the medicine early in the day, when I first started taking the medicine I wasnt told that and I didnt see much a change in the heartburn or other symptoms.After a couple months the doctor on a followup visit avised me to take them in the morning before I eat anything.

9 months. I applied a thin layer daily after washing my face in the evenings. After 9 months I

was very disappointed.",Low
seroquel,1,"seroquel bipolar disorder, hypomania. - None. I only took them for a couple of days, but had to stop because of the side-effects. The biggest side-effect was that it made me experience shock-waves through my head and sometimes even my body, just like if someone would have turned on and off a lamp very quickly. That side-effect ended the same time I stopped taking Seroquel. The other one was that everything started to smell and taste very bad. It�s hard to explain exactly how, but it was a mix of vodka and mould. After I stopped taking the medication it took 2 weeks for the taste/smell-problem to disapear. I was prescribed with Seroquel after I was released from hospital after a period of deep depression to help me to sleep better and stop me from becoming hypomanic.",Low
benadryl,9,"benadryl hives - At the onset of my condition of hives, I tried to avoid taking any medications and was hoping to ride it out.  By the second day, the itching got unbearable so I gave in and took Benadryl to counteract the severe itching I was having.  At this stage, the hives were in full swing so the medication was only 50% effective but it helped enough for me to resist scratching myself.  As time went by, the itching slowly subsided and the hives went away (lasted about five days). When I first took Benadryl, I took two tablets (50 mg) on an empty stomach.  The medication left me nauseated and lethargic. After the initial dosage taken (described above), I reduced the dosage to just one tablet (25 mg) but I increased the frequency to one tablet every two hours.  I figured this would be equivalent to the recommended directions of 2 tablets every 4 hours but I spread the tablets out to keep the effects of the medication fresh.  I also learned not to take this medication on an empty stomach.  It worked since I did not suffer any nausea, drowsiness, dry mouth, or upset stomach.",high

lyrica,8,"lyrica fibromyalgia - Muscle pain from fibromyalgia was reduced; able to more actively participate in life activities. fatigue, decreased mental acuity, weight gain. Once I started taking Lyrica, it took a couple of weeks to gain full advantage of its benefits. Originally, I has been places on a dose of 200mg three times a day, which I believe what was recommended for fibromyalgia. The resultant relief of pain was pretty good. However, I found myself very tired and mentally dull. I switched doctors and was given the reduced dosage of 75mg. twice a day. Although my pain relief results have not been as good, I do still have some relief while at the same time being able to be more alert and functional.",high

As far as I am concerned that Dr. took 6 years out of my life. New Female Dr. finally put me back on Armour.  It was unavailable for almost a year. I think it was all about money. Armour is less costly and moree effective. Levoxyl did nothing for me. I felt flat. lack of energy and spirit. I took  mcg. of Levoxyl for 6 years after being on Armour Thyroid for 17 years.

zoloft,10,"zoloft depression - This drug literally changed my life and I wish I had started taking it earlier in life.  So many problems would have been solved for me. I was never happy, cryed often and had no self worth at all.  I was also very anxious and uncomfortable around people and avoided many social situations because of this.  In short I was not enjoying anything at all about life or work!  When I started taking Zoloft (under my doctor' care) it was like a miracle for me.  I went back to school!  I pursued a new career (my old job was nothing other than a hiding place for me) I blossomed!  I honestly do not know if this drug has the same effect on everyone but I recommend trying it. I should be the poster child for Zoloft.  I am still taking it and may be for the rest of my life.  As for people who complain about anti-depressants, there is only one thing to say to them, They obviously have never known the debilitating effects of depression! No libido I started taking 50 mg. of Zoloft for about a month while my doctor monitored me.  And then he gradually increased the dosage.",high

In combination with the Flagyl, which breaks down the biofilm that the Borrelia bacteria protect themselves from hostile environments including exposure to antibiotics, the Biaxin can kill the bacteria when they emerge from their biofilms which is weakened by Flagyl. I only experienced one side effect from this medication which I will mention as follows. The side effect that experienced throughout the course of treatment was the persuasive bitter taste in the mouth. Other than that single side effect I did not experience any other side effects that I am aware of. The treatment details using the combination of Biaxin and Flagyl together was to assist in the eradication of the cell wall deficient bacteria called Borrelia Burgdorferi.

After being on the medicine as many years as I have, I don't think it is as effective as others may be, but I have tried many...Prozac,Zoloft and numerous others I don't remember the name of and nothing worked as well for me as Paxil..Another note is that anxiety runs in my family and a few aunts and uncles in my family have had the same good luck with Paxil.

I had no idea they could cause this reaction. they were good pain killers. asthmatic condition.  Heavy chest, dry cough, weakness, cumulative effect over days.  Still prone to shortness of breath and tightness and heavy chest feelings, very sensitive to sulphides in wine and vinegars etc, was not before this. I only became aware of this connection when I took some I had left for  a period pain, once again within seconds I was really ill. Not sure what this section requires ? It's a straight forward case of pain relief in response to the flu virus.  the symptoms and the side effects became inter-twined, so it was not apparent that this drug was causing a reaction and worse than that I continued taking it as I became more and more ill.  This is an over the counter drug, I would have appreciated more information from my pharmacist.  I have tried to tell as many people as possible about what happened. After I have stopped taking the treatment I am left with a susceptibility to asthmatic type symptoms, it was also scary as I instinctively knew I was getting worse and became concerned something very serious was going on.

The worst were the terrible nausea, gas and abdominal distress.  I would be so nauseous after taking the drug that I would have to lie down for about forty five minutes before I could function.

Topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude, barometric pressures, humidity levels, environmental triggers such as smoke, strong smells, loud noises, and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  Before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  After settling in on topamax these things didn't bother me like they used to. When first starting the drug, diet soda tasted metallic and downright horrible.  There was definitely an adjustment period of getting used to the drug and increasing the dosage in small increments was important.  I could feel changes in my brain that are hard to describe.  Almost like the top was a little bit ""lifted"".  It was worth getting through this period for the results, though.  They definitely went away as my body got accustomed to the drug.  Once that happened, the migraines lessened and one pleasant side effect was that I didn't snack as often.  No ""mindless munching.""  I lost some weight without trying.  I felt that it was difficult to retrieve thoughts or find the right word at times.  I found it would take a few seconds longer to put my thoughts into words.  Felt a little ""spacey.""  As I mentioned before, I got through it after getting used to the drug.  It took several weeks but after having 17 migraine days a month and going down to 8 it was worth it. Started at 25mg 2x a day for several days and started titrating up by adding 25mg to the evening dose every 3-4 days, depending on how I felt.  Got up to 100 mg. a day for the first year.

A day after the last pill is taken, I have a headache for about a couple of days. Two weeks out of the month I take 20 mg, every morning. I start on a Sunday a week before my menstrual cycle.

At first, it took about a week to start feeling any effects on the severe hot flashes that I was feeling after being put into instant menopause. But gradually the dug started working and now my hot flashes and mood swings are practically non-existent. None. I started receiving Premarin 0.9 mg immediately after a complete hysterectomy. After it became effective, I was reduced to a dosage of 0.625 mg and it works just fine.",high
sotret,8,"sotret mild but resistant acne - Treatment was very effective, effects started to be noticeable after 3 weeks. After 3 months skin had cleared and as additional benefits, hair and skin were much less oily (no longer needed to wash hair daily as it was not so oily any more. Pores shrunk and much less visible. Side effects started about 3 days after starting treatment. Initially lips became very dry and had to use lip salve continuosly. Then I started getting nosebleeds as the skin inside my nose became very dry and fragile.
Skin became very dry and sensitive during treatment and eyes very sensitive to light.
I had to have regular blood tests to check my lipid profile but it was not affected by the treatment.
During the second course of treatment I also got very mild depression symptoms so I stopped the treatment. I suffered with mild acne and many whiteheads that were resistant to all other topical and antibiotic treatment. My dermatologist was reluctant to prescribe Accutane as I had a mild acne but eventually let me try a course at the lowest dose (0.5/mg/kg). I had 2 courses of treatment with Accutane. The first time it was highly effective (side effects were tolerable and worth it as I got great results) so I stopped after 4 months. after about a year the acne returned (much less than previously) so I took another course and after that it was definitely gone. 
There are side effects but if you can tolerate them, it is a very effective treatment.
I had to do a pregnancy test prior to starting each course and full blood test and had to take oral contraceptives throughout the treatment as there is a risk of birth defects. I also had to see dermatologist every 2 weeks initially then monthly and have my blood tests repeated.
Tretment was very expensive (including cost of drugs, blood tests, consultation fees) but worth it.",high
dilantin,2,"dilantin anticonvulsant - none, I was unable to take  the drug to achieve the benefits as I had a reaction.

xyzal,8,"xyzal seasonal allergies - I did not see any significant benefits for treating the histamine reaction- which was due to a bug bite and subsequent allergic response.  Sensations and symptoms included inflammation, redness, swelling to the point of limited mobility (bite was on hand) and itching, which the Xyzal did not effectively treat; however, the xyzal appeared to help with the seasonal allergies related to hay fever.  For the topical condition, diphenhydramine was preferred. Drowsiness.  Slight dizziness, but not remarkable.  I also thought that the drug's slow-release effect may not be as modulated as one would hope since the drowsiness and related symptoms came in spurts rather than in a constant flow, if you know what i mean.  I did not find that caffeine was helpful to promote alertness and I was nervous about driving while taking this particular medication. I took the every evening every 24 hours for 14 days, according to my doctor's instructions.  He did not want me to ""mix antihistamines"" and even though I thought Benadryl might be more effective, I didn't want a drug that would make me that sleepy and also that I would have to take every 6 hours, as opposed to every 24 hours.  I would have prefferred a Xyzal dose that i could take every 12 hours, and then i could use benadryl at night without worrying about mixing anti-histamines, but since this was not possible I just used the Xyzal plus topical antihistamine creme on site of bug bite.",high

The side effects were like a prevision of menopause - huge weight gain (20 pounds), incredible mood swings and severe bloating. My overall feeling was quite depressed and it took me a while to figure out that it had to do with the drug, not with what was going on in my personal life.

noritate,10,"noritate rash under nasal area - I had the drug initally offered to me by my dermatologist in sample tube years ago.  I found it very effective, despite only dabbing on the smallest amount due to only having small sample tube.  Yet despite quick clear-ups...I would occasionally have recurrances under my nose with the rash.  I have struggled with this rash for over 20 years.  With the last outbreak, while having minimal amounts left in the sample tube, I went in to my dermatologist and got a full prescription in about June of 2009.  Not only was I able to use a bit more in application this time, but it obviously was not an expired product.  I found the long-term rash hsf completely cleared up within less than a week.  While this was not new to me with this product, the fact that I have had no recurrance whatsoever in over four months is the great news. Absolutely none After washing my face with my long-term personal choice of face wash (Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash) and using a Strident sensitive skin cleaning pad, I would apply the Noritate cream sparingly over the rash under my nose at night.

I had never had a yeast infection before, nor have I ever had problems getting rid of a yeast infection.   I believe the ring was the culprit. I went to my doctor to complain about the yeast infections.  It seemed like every time I inserted a new NuvaRing, I got a yeast infection.  She told me to use Monistat, and see if that works.  It worked for a week, but then I developed another yeast infection.   I went back to my doctor/gyno.  She prescribed me Diflucan, an antifungal pill taken by mouth.  I was to take 1 pill every time I started a new ring.  I still had yeast infections.  My doctor then advised me to take the Diflucan every other day for 3 days after starting a new ring.  No improvement.   She then prescribed me a vaginal cream containing steroids and an  anti-inflammatory.   I gave up -  the next time I went to the doctor, I had her prescribe me a new birth control.

I found my nose clearer during the daytime and I had less 'sniffles' as compared to days when I did not take the Zyrtec at all.  Overall, it improved my symptoms notably. If I took my Zyrtec in the a.m., then by mid-afternoon I could not function.  Drowziness, brain-fog, fatigue.  If I took Zyrtec at dinner-time it appeared not to affect me.  If I forgot and did not take it until bed-time, then the next morning I could 'not wake up'.  Severe tiredness. I discovered that I had to take the Zyrtec at dinner-time.

Only side effect is that it is highly addictive. Was very hard to get off the treatment even when going down 1 mg per 2 weeks. Used the liquid for that. Could go cold turkey with all other anti-depressants but not this one. Once I went from 20 m/g per day to 15 m/g per day had to return back to initial starting dosage because my body went into extreme withdrawal. Extremely effective in reducing anxiety and depression.

My sensitive skin, will still peel regardless but especially if irritated by winter dryness or rubbing against my partner's beard. I have peeled with every tretinoin product I've tried and this is the least bothersome. I am also more sensitive to the sun. Unlike other drugs, I have not ever cracked or felt discomfort unless I get excesssive sun or dryness. I don't use it every day in the winter. I spread this on my entire face every night on clean skin. In the winter, I follow with a moisturizer. In the morning, I use metrogel daily.

I felt spacey and ""out of it"" but at the same time agitated.  I didn't feel an actual absence of pain as much as I felt ""oh well, gee gosh, I have pain.  Isn't that a bummer.""  In other words, the medication seemed to be more about changing my attitude towards the pain rather then actual reduction of pain.  I subsequently
stopped taking it and turned to tylenol with codeine.  This worked much better in my opinion.  I subsequently refused any additional prescriptions for vicodin and requested tylenol with codeine instead.  I have since switched to a natural pain relief option that is a combination of white willow, feverfew, skullcap, and kelp.  It is called ""Relief"".  I believe the manufacturer is ""Nature's Way.""  Although, I am in daily pain for assorted issues (structural) I avoid medicating myself unless it is particularly dibilitating.

Also, I gained weight and felt like I was retaining water. A week before my period I would feel weak and feverish. My OBGYN explained that this oral contraceptive uses a synthetic progestin known as drospirenone. He suggested that it might be the cause of my negative side effects.

So far I'm pretty happy- nothing drastic, but hopefully continued use will help me to age gracefully and not drastically. Definitely some peeling in the first 2-4 weeks especially around my chin. I also noticed that applying other products- like facial wash and sunscreen had a slight burning during the earlier stages. I wash my face in the evening, let it dry, and apply the cream. It recommended that I wait 20-30 minutes after washing but I generally don't have that kind of time- I think that's to avoid irritation which isn't a problem anyway.",high

fosamax,2,"fosamax post menapausal osteopenia - I didn't realize any benefits since the medication is preventative and needed to be taken over time to prevent osteoporosis. I had experienced some bone density issued related to  long term use of Prednisone or a period of years. Within two weeks of the first dose I began feeling a lump in my upper stomach ,even though I took my pill first thing in the morning and remained standing for more than two hours. I still started to have a feeling of acid reflux which I have never had.  I reported continuing burning sensations in upper abdomen ,and gasy production which produced belches and burps , to the prescribing Dr. immediately but he suggested continuing the med ,and use an antacid which I tried. By the second dose I had serious heartburn ,reported it to the Dr. then discontinued the medication and they changed me to Actonel, once a week ,which had none of the same adverse side effect. I had a bone density study done and it was stated that I had osteopenia, related to over 12 years of prednisone and seroid use to treat my Sarcoidosis.

At the time I was seeing a Rhuemotogogist who was treating me for side effects like joint pain and swelling. I was told I didn't have osteoporosis yet, but to start taking the Fosamax to prevent it .

It made all of my allergy symptoms disappear (itchy eyes, hayfever, nasal congestion etc)  The side effects were extreme cotton mouth, and I mean extreme.

Not a huge difference, but it was big enough for my family to notice.  It seemed to me though, after time, that my body got immune to the medication and I seemed to be back to the manic stages again.  I have been on tons of anti-depression medications that are prescribed for depression and bipolar disorder and it seems to my doctors/psychiatrists that my body just gets immune to them. fatigue and memory loss I really wish this was the medication that finally worked for me, but unless some miracle happens, it's back to the drawing board.

My doctor asked me to take Nexium once a day until they were gone to see if the tightness in my check, the indigestion, and the heartburn could be cured by the pills. The tightness in the check and indigestion were not signs of heart problems as the doctor discovered. To date, the pills seemed to have worked.",high

I do not have a constant barrage of depressed thoughts or emotions when I am on the drug.  When my husband and I decided to try to have a baby, my ob-gyn suggested that I switch to Wellbutrin.  Some anti-depressants may carry a small risk of side-effects to the baby in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  My ob-gyn felt that taking Wellbutrin may reduce these risks.   After 1 or 2 months on Wellbutrin, I began to feel very irrtable and anxious.  My chest began to tighten painfully with even the thought of something stressful.  After 4 months on Wellbutrin, I had my first panic attack ever.  I threw the pills in the trash and went to see a psychiatrist.

My doctor said it was not useful to do another bone scan to see if there had been a change in a year so I have no idea if there was any benefit.  I have been experiencing fairly severe leg pains for the past year and could not find out what they were from.  Did numerous tests, no results.  Then I saw on the insert that side effects could be muscle, bone or joint pain and when I read a comment on here describing dull aching in one leg in particular radiating down from the hip and below the knee.

I didn't change my eating habits in any negative way, and ended up gaining 20 lbs! I received the shot once every three months for a total of a year.

I am definitely doing more research before I take another birth control again.",high
ultram,8,"ultram cervical osteoarthritis - Tramadol decreases the severity of pain associated with neck movement. It is not an opiate however it does provide pain relief (for me) along the lines of a mild narcotic without the ""euphoric"" or mind numbing effects. It allows me greater latitude of neck movement. It is very evident to me when the medication is wearing off as I can no longer turn my neck more than approximately 25 degrees. This drug has been a lifesaver for me and can sometimes even head off my milder migraines. I've personally experienced no side effects other than an occasional jerky type feeling in my movements. I have heard from others that this medication, although non narcotic can be difficult to cease due to withdrawal symptoms. Personally I have  had no problem with this. This medication has been known to cause seizures and is not to be taken by anyone who has experienced a seizure. I take two 50 mg. tablets as needed up to three times a day.",high
lipitor,6,"lipitor cholesterol - Benefits to taking Lipitor was that it helped reduce my total cholesterol numbers.  While that was a positive, the side-effects began to make me question the overall reduction in cholesterol numbers. When I first started taking Lipitor I did not notice any side effects.  Approx. three months into taking the drug, however, I started noticing upset stomach.  At first I thought perhaps the caffeine in my coffee was creating the upset as I started drinking more than one cup daily.  I cutback on the coffee and did not notice a difference in stomach issues.  Approximately 6-8 months into taking the drug, I began to experience some discomfort in the legs.  As a distance walker I analyzed my workout routine to see if I had added something different but had not.  I quit taking the drug 12 months (give or take) after starting. Treatment was simple:  take on tablet daily at bedtime.  The drug was (and did) to help reduce my overall cholesterol numbers.",high

I think this is a rather weak way to manage daily pain associated with IC. A little bit of nausea when the pill actually worked.  No side effects at all when the pill didn't work. My IC cocktail started to work after about a month and there wasn't much need for pain killers anymore so I just stopped taking Tramadol. 

In the future, when my IC would flare up, I requested no Tramadol and instead received Tylenol with Codiene.  It worked much better.",high

Although it is hard to tell if this is just from the medication or some other reason. But overall I am happy with the medication and plan on continuing to take it as long as I need to. Before I started taking the medication, my blood pressure was extremely high. I didn't exercise much and I am was over weight. At my doctor's orders, I began taking the medication and it took a while to take effect, but when it did, it has and still continues to keep my blood pressure within the normal range.

Hairline/Temples: Considerable re-growth. Not back to ""normal"", but still very impressive.

Number one, metformin did seem to lower my blood sugar over a short amount of time in the beginning.  Number two, as a medication I found necessary in my life, I have found it fairly inexpensive to purchase as a generic drug. The treatment side effects I experienced were in the beginning.

Just be sure to have your liver enzymes checked regularly if you are on this drug. I was on 90 mg daily, one dose of 60 mg and one dose of 30 mg.  It was prescribed to me for fibromyalgia and depression, however, I did not notice much improvement on this drug but I was not on it for a real long time either so it may just take longer to notice benefit but it definitely affected my liver.

To my knowledge I had no side effects with the drug. I just took the drug for a year twice a day.

I did not see any benefits over the time I used the product (3 months) but was advised that I needed to continue treatment. There were no noticeable side effects that I was aware of.  The product is an ointment with a rather oily feel and needs to be left on the effected areas for some period of time so I applied it at night.  I did not find that it had any effect in any positive or negative way over the period I applied it. I was asked by the prescribing doctor to apply the ointment once a day to the affected areas (the back of both of my hands).  This was the entire process and I was to report back to him within a period of approximately six months.  This was a rather experimental treatment.  I applied the product as instructed but did not notice any repigmentation during the time I applied it (around 3 months).

The aspirin worked well, I can take the Niaspan with no problems.

I use weaker hydrocortisone cream on my hands as a last resort.  Luckily that cream is just stron enough to offer some relief. Over time (many years) I ntoiced reduced effectiveness and splitting of the skin in inflamed areas (on hands), despite using this product very sparingly. I use this cream as little as possible - only when I have a serious flare-up of the eczema.  When I do use the cream I apply a reasonable amount to the skin - just enough to makae sure some cream comes in contact with all of the inflamed area.  I use the cream once or twice a day during the flare up.  Once I notice the inflammation is going down I stop using it- and teh skin finishes healing up on its own without further nedication.

After having side effects, I did try to lower the dosage to 10m by cutting the pills in half, but still felt the bad effects. At first, I did not associate my increasing tiredness and general lack of energy with the medicine. I just thought I was getting sick with a virus. Then, as time went on, I started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.  By the time I started to think the way I was feeling might be related to the Lipitor, I realized, besides the physical symptoms,  I was in a state of depression.  As soon as I quit taking the pills, all the bad symptoms cleared.  A few days later, I tried taking less (half), but, again started feeling bad. As previously stated, because my cholesterol levels were high, the doctor said I should take Lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. But, because I was unable to take the Lipitor for the entire month, the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  After taking the Lipitor for about 10 days, I stopped taking it.

Further, you are told to consume food to protect the lining of your stomach from this medication.  Not always something you want to do when you are experiencing a lot of pain because pain can make you feel like vomiting. Stomach issues, burning  The more adverse affect was the constant pain due to the continuing inflammation with the added and increasing reduction in movement, and muscle usage.  Worst, was the waste of time.  Another med could have been prescribed in the time I used this medicine that would have been more effective and time healing would not have been wasted.  In fact, another anti-inflammatory was prescribed that provided immediate benefits (30 minutes) without the build-up in your system that the M.D. and pharmacist said Naprosyn requires before it becomes effective. Tried various dosages from the lowest, to more frequency.  It simply had little affect on inflammation or pain.  No other pain medication was added to this treatment and no other medication was given.  I had a car accident and suffered whiplash, thoracic muscle strain, herniation of entire lumbar region, etc.  Inflammation was rampant from hip level up.  Any relief would have been noted and appreciated.  Another drug was later prescribed, another anti-inflammatory, which proved just how much the naprosyn did not work.  I had immediate pain relief in 30 minutes and notable inflammation reduction very quickly.  In fact, after a 3 week loading of this drug, I was able to get out of bed, move around, and be functional!  The Doctor insisted on trying this level, Naprosyn, first and then changed after 6 weeks, to supposedly stronger medication in some kind of protocol progression.

The gradual stepping down of dosage was monitored by a doctor and was even done slower than normal but it did not prevent the ""brain zaps."" Headaches and some nausea also accompanied the shocks.

imitrex,10,"imitrex migraine headaches - Complete relief from pain with one 100 mg tablet. Alleviated the sensitivity to light, noise and nausea. Symptoms would abate in one to two hours. A little ""fuzzy headed"" until it took effect. This is taken as needed. It works best to take at the onset of the migraine and not to wait to see if will go away.",high
aciphex,8,aciphex gerd - My heartburn greatly reduced and I could sleep at night so the GERD was successfully addressed. Very frequent and bad dysentery. Stomach Cramps were also an issue and if those side effects could be eliminated this would then be the perfect GERD relief drug. 1 pill twice a day with meals with lots of liquids.,high
citalopram,10,"citalopram anxiety - My doctor has this combined with Hydroxozine and I feel wonderful.  I have taken Paxil, Lexapro and a few others since I was about 12.  I would def. say that this drug combination has worked the best.  The first two weeks I experienced withdrawls from my other med(Lexapro) but after that, I am great and back to new :) For the first couple of weeks I had withdrawls from prior medication.  But that is all I have experienced. I believe that this, and the hydroxozine are a miracle drug combo.  I have suffered from anxiety since around age 7 and I finally have a ""normal""  life.",high
reclipsen,10,"reclipsen skin breakouts/birth control - Treatment benefits include clear, glowing skin, regular menstrual cycles, and reliable birth control. Treatment side effects include breast tenderness for about a month after first doseage, and some ovular soreness. Treatment details include taking a pill eachday at the same time for maximum effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, and taking the 5 placebo pills to help remember to take a pill every day.",high
prednisolone,10,"prednisolone prickly heat/heat rash - The prickly heat would be cleared up over night. The itch would disappear within a few hours the bumps would loose all redness but would remain slightly raised for a couple of days I had no side effects at all, but as i need to write 50 words it may also be worth noting that I had the positive effect of the painful Achilles tendon I had also disappeared after taking the tablets for 2 days As soon as the prickly heat starts I had to take 6 tablets daily for a maximun of 10 days I have never had to take the tablets for more than 3 consecutive days",high

differin,10,"differin localized acne - Differin has practically eliminated my acne.  I also used it on my forehead, where I have brown spots from a college-days sunburn (appx 10 years ago).  The spots have clearly faded, though are not completely gone. Side effects were peeling and some redness, but only occurred the time that i used too much Differin.  I knowingly put more than prescribed on my chin in hopes of getting rid of an outbreak before vacation.  The redness and peeling was very noticeable. Treatment includes adding only about 1/3 pea sized amount to my chin area and the same amount to my forehead after cleansing at night.  This I do daily.  I combined this with a regular alpha-hydroxy exfoliation night creme (applied after the Differin dries) in order to catalyze (by my own approximation) the skin rejuvenation/renewal.",high
celexa,9,"celexa depression - My father became extremely depressed following his mild stroke. About 2 weeks after we increased the dose from 10-20mg, there was a significant change in his attitude and he embraced life again. Occasional light-headedness. After his mild stroke, my Dad could not continue his previously active routine. He hated not being able to drive his new car to meet his friends for their daily breakfast. He was always on the go, even at home he was constantly puttering with gadgets & watching stocks on the computer. All of this had suddenly been taken from him and he was angry & frustrated that he was unable to do these previously simple tasks. Depression set in and he just gave up on life. He would even dream that he was dead. He cried & moaned a lot (my Dad never cried before). I was pleased with the results from this medication.",high
effexor,5,effexor depression - it did help alleviate the depression Unfortunately It caused me to gain 20 lbs in less than 3 months...I have been on many different antidepressants and this one was the worst when it came to weight gain daily dose of medication...it helped alleviate depression symptoms but caused weight gain,high
effexor-xr,4,"effexor-xr anxiety - eased my anxiety, helped me start going to work more. This drug was extremely difficult to start. I had headaches and dizziness for weeks. Also caused digestive problems - bloating and flatulence. Had no energy - before I took this drug I was a very active person but once on it I had no energy to excercise. Also craved sugary and carbohydrate rich food which ended up giving me thrush and other fungal infections. Caused concentration problems. I stuggled to concentrate on my work for a full day. I also felt very flat. Am stopping this drug and going on to paroxetine again as the side effects outweighed the benefits.",Low
alprazolam,5,"alprazolam panic attacks - It was very good in controlling the panic attacks. Before taking it I was even unable to drive my car down the road without having a panic attack. I worked liked magic from the very first dose. I could resume to being close to feeling like a normal person again.  It worked well for panic attack prevention. There were no real side effects other than a dry mouth. I still suffered from some anxiety symtoms such as feeling a bit nervous restless, sometimes had trouble sleeping. If I drank alcohol at the same time in small amounts, I felt even better and seemed to have no bad feeling at all but that was short lived, and as I found out later on also dangerous. And Just don""t ever stop taking it suddenly. Thats also very dangerous. The treatment was to take three 1 mg tablet a day, with food. The trouble was that I became very reliant on the medication and felt I needed to keep taking it. Then one day I decided to quit and I just stopped taking it. I don""t know why I did not  slowly wean myself off over a couple of weeks. Over the course of the next three days I never got out of the house I was sick, shaking uncontrollably, having hallucinations both audial and visual I thought I was going to die. I felt like  hell. A friend found me and took me to the doctor. It was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life it was the withdrawal symptoms from the drug. All I needed to do was take more, but I felt to afraid. To this day I cant tell you why I just could""nt think straight.",high
seasonique,9,seasonique birth control - My acne has definatly cleared up and my period is so much better and lighter. unlike all the other adds i had absolutly no bleed through. I have gotten migranes since i was a teenager and since starting this pill i feel they are more likely. I really like seasonique. i love only having four periods a year,high
vicodin,1,"vicodin shoulder & neck pain - None.  Vicodin is a narcotic for severe pain. I was prescribed it after weeks of physical therapy and ibuprophin did not reduce the pain in my shoulder and neck following a ski crash. Much to my dismay, the drug made me feel extremely nauseated. Though I did not actually throw up, I felt like it for a day. Furthermore, the pain in my neck and shoulder did not improve. Even if it had, I would have discontinued Vicodin anyway. My doctor did not mention any possible side effects, nor did he tell me it is a narcotic. Apparently, it is a drug of abuse. Also, nausea is a common side effect. I was only told that it was a pain killer that would alleviate my discomfort.",Low
valtrex,9,"valtrex genital herpes - the sores disappeared much sooner than with regular treatments (acyclovir) and the pain disappeared the next day. Due to my chronic gastritis, I had minor stomach aches but nothing too bad The treatment was started on the second day of the sore outbreak, and I noticed the effect very quickly: the next day I felt barely any pain and the sore disappeared much faster than usual (about 4-5 days overall vs the previous 7-9 days)",high

clarinex,10,clarinex sinus allergies/hives - I sometimes get hives or sinus type allergies.  When I take this anti-histamine I notice that it works quickly and is very effective for hours.  I never get sleepy like I do with most other over the counter anti-histamines. I did not notice any side effects. One small pill a day is all it takes to relieve my mild to moderate sinus allergies and occassional hives.,high
tenormin,4,"tenormin an unknown ekg wave abnormality - Decreased nausea, dizziness when standing, pins and needles sensation. Eyes and Skin less sensitive to sunlight. Extreme sleepiness (25mg feels like I took a Tylenol PM). Slight inability to concentrate. Depression of mood, slight irritability. I have noticed some suggest this is also prescribed for anxiety, I haven't noticed any reduction in anxiety, I have noticed if I'm irritated the irritability seems to last a bit longer than normal. It has done nothing to increase my motivation or productivity. I already have a low heart rate, so an hour after taking it I always take 200mg caffeine + 2 Primatene tablets (25mg Ephedrine HCL) to raise heartbeat while the Atenolol stabilizes it. The Ephedrine also helps to counteract sleepiness and depressed mood Atenolol causes in my system. I was going to quit taking it but over 2 months I have slowly experienced an increase in my health, before I was almost bed-ridden, now I can get up and walk around for extended periods of time. I originally had a bad case of Mono a few years back and it still showed in my system, he said it probably caused a bad case of Chronic Fatigue but it is not considered a real medical condition, so he wrote me a script for Atenolol after my EKG. They took 6 EKG's that read no heartbeat and the 7th read a supposedly impossible wave, I did every test from two separate doctors, they have no idea what it is.",Low
neurontin,5,"neurontin chonic pain - I did see improvement in numbness and tinglng in upper extremities. Helps marginally for sleep. Poor concentration, drowsiness, dizziness, memory problems. My physian tried to titrate dose to 2400mg per day. The side effects were intolerable to the point that I was having prolems at work. I currently take 600mg hs. I plan to discontinue this medication as the side effects are not worth the marginal benefit",high
ritalin,5,"ritalin depression - When I first began taking the Ritalin, I noticed a dramatic effect on my mood.  I felt wonderful!  I was energetic and positive and I felt that I could handle anything that came my way.  I don't want to sound as though I felt euphoric or manic - I just felt really GOOD about life.  However, after only a few days, that sense of confident well-being drained away. Initially, the medication kept me awake all night but that only happened for a night or two.  I take them on an empty stomach in the morning and sometimes my hands shake very slightly for a while but it's not enough to cause any problems. My psychiatrist put me on it to 'give a boost' to my other antidepressant.  He says I am taking a miniscule amount, and that I could increase the dosage if I wished but I have been reluctant to do so.  Perhaps I should - I may not be taking enough to be effective but I am on three different antidepressants and I feel uneasy about sharply increasing the Ritalin dose.  In short, initially, I felt GREAT but now I feel just the same as ever - struggling with the thoughts that cause lack of energy & enjoyment in many spheres of life.",high

paxil,9,"paxil panic attack - My anxiety when driving was lowered. None One day I was driving on a freeway (280, San Francisco Bay area) and felt like I was going to faint.  It was a clear day, not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one, 101.  I pulled over to the shoulder so I could compose myself.  I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright, I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times, I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor, I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.  I began taking it and, it took a while, though I wasn't ready to try the freeway right away, but it has definitely helped. I am now more willing to just get on the freeway.  I have not noticed any side effects from taking it or changes in my personality...I did not need it for depression or any other anxiety but freeway driving.",high
metronidazole,6,"metronidazole diverticulitis - The benefits were that the infection was eleminated. The infection had apparently grown over a period of several months and then reached a point that it suddenly was accute. I say it grew slowly over several months because my abdominal area, even as far up as including my waist, had grown from about 30 inches to about 33 inches and I required clothing two sizes larger. I had become more and more weak but thought that it was my age (even though up until a few months before the swelling started I was still hiking up to 10 or 11 miles a day in the Andes in Chili or in the Canadian Rockies. Weakness had suddenly become so accute that it was causing my heart to labor so much that radio-active dye x-rays were taken of my heart. My abdomin had a sonigram to see if I had ovarian cancer. The metronidazole 500 mg and the ciprofloxacin 500 mg wer prescribed one tablet of each twice a day for two weeks. However, after several days I began to have slight light headedness, tingling in my fingers, much short-term memory loss, and constant whistling in my ears. By the sixth day these side-effects had intensified to the point that my hands were shaking, I was dizzy, and the doctor told me to discontinue the meds.Eleven weeks have passed and I still have CONSTANT whistling in my ears, my short term memory has improved but has not totally returned, and my bowels still do not work without taking a stimulant. I am taking probotics (460 mg each,6 billion total microorganisms per capsule twice daily), eating such as Activia daily, etc to try to repace the healthy bacteria level in my intestines but as stated earlier this is not yet accomplished. I am very tired of hearing the constant whistling in my ears. This may be covered in the treatment benefits section,  The prescribed dosage was 500 mg (along with ciprofloxacin 500 mg) both twice daily for two weeks: however, by the sixth day the side effects were severe enough that the doctor told me to discontinue taking both the metronidazole and the ciprofloxacin.",high
mevacor,1,"mevacor high cholesterol - NONE!!!!! I began having very irregular heart rhythm within about 2 1/2 weeks of taking this medicine.  Feeling like I was going to pass out or maybe my heart would even stop beating. I began having very irregular heart rhythm within about 2 1/2 weeks of taking this medicine.  I began feeling like I was going to pass out or maybe my heart would stop beating & I would just keel over & die if I didn't immediately start moving around. I could be sitting or laying down in bed & these ""spells"" would come on out of the blue & very regularly.  I spent one night up all night laying on the couch because it was so bad that I was afraid that if I fell asleep I might not wake up. I tried to pretend it would go way at first but then made an appointment with my Dr. first & then a cardiologist, it was just too scary. My Dr. didn't believe that it was the medicine. By the time I could get in to see the cardiologist & have the heart monitor holster, echocardiogram etc. done I had been off the medicine for 2 weeks & the symptoms had lessened & of course did not appear while I was being tested. The Dr. thought I was crazy & that there was no way it was the medicine & that maybe I was having panic attacks.  I have never had a panic attack in my life & I have had similar heart rhythm symptoms with other meds that quit when I stopped taking them & I know my own body.  It WAS the lovastatin.  It took a year & a half before I started feeling normal again & didn't have these attacks come on sometimes.  I truly believe the lovastatin had an affect on my heart that took that long to get better. I will NEVER take another cholesterol med again that has the possible side affects of affecting muscles.  The heart is a muscle.  I also found that other people have had this same experience while taking statins while I was researching this on the internet.  Neither Dr. would even look at the article I printed out about it & it was even written by another Dr. who was researching statin side affects.",Low
zovirax,10,"zovirax cold sores - Shortened time span of cold sore. 
Sometimes alleviating symptoms entirely. None If you take one pill as soon as you feel the tingle of a cold sore coming on, often it will not even appear at all. I know you might think, ""Maybe there wasn't really one in the first place."" But if you get cold sores regularly, you know. Sometimes if I couldn't get to the pills right away and a cold sore did appear, I would take a total of 4-5 pills in the course of the next 24 hours, and the sores would often be gone within 2 days instead of the usual 10. If you can't get to the pills within the first 24 hours, there is really not much good they can do after that, from my experience. This drug is kind of expensive--if I recall from before I had insurance, it was $50-75 for a bottle of Zovirax, but now they have a generic form so it is probably less. Regardless, this drug is worth its weight in gold.",high
solodyn,1,"solodyn acne - While on the drug I did not have any large, red acne lesions. Lupus-like symptoms that were very severe:
light sensitivity
extreme fatigue
severe joint point
iritis (inflammation of the iris of the eye)
knee, wrist and finger pain that continues 4 months after stopping the drug
iritis flared again 4 months after stopping the drug After I turned 38 my skin changed.  It became much oilier and I started having large acne lesions again around my chin.  This was especially true before a period or when I was under stress at work.  I decided to see a dermatologist as I was sick of the acne.  I started Yaz which was alright, as well as Retin-A.  This didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed Solodyn.  Looking back now, I think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks, I just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  I thought I was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  I was just about to go to an orthopod when I decided to investigate the Solodyn more.  I read about the joint pain and Lupus-like symptoms, stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  She did some bloodwork and I had a positive ANA blood result (mid-positive, not low).  This is one indicator of lupus.  My dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  I called the office again a week later as I was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  I got a phone call back that basically said ""hello, hypochondriac, you do not have lupus.""  Then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  I went to my GP who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and I started 7 weeks of drops.  She also referred me to a rheumatologist who ran a number of tests and told me she's seen minocycline drugs do this to people a lot and she would never take one or have her children take one - great.  That's my saga.  Now dealing with another iritis flair up and a lot of pain in my left knee, 4 months after stopping the drug.  Please don't take this drug!!!",Low
paxil-cr,7,"paxil-cr ocd - I felt reduced anxiety and compulsions;  less need for perfection;  better able to live with ""good enough""; less stress and happier; no more depression. Ihad to stop nursing; constipation (must take 2 stool softeners per day); it killed my sex drive; skipping more than two days causes serious headaches, after three days of missed meds you go into withdrawal...much like heroin withdrawal.  Never have I been so ill or wanted to die. Along with psychotherapy, I started taking prozac, with no effect after 2 months.  I switched to paxil with constipation and I needed at least 10 hours of sleep to come out of it each morning. I switched to selexa with no effect.  I then tried zyprexa  which caused me to gain 10 lbs in a month, gave me memory loss and I started lactating again.  By then, they had come out with paxil-cr (extended release) and I have been on that ever since.  I would like to switch to something that doesn't kill my sex drive and make me want to die when I go off of it, but I am afraid to stop without the proof of something else working better.",high
clarithromycin,8,"clarithromycin sinus infection due to seasonal allergy - It cleared up the sinus infection within 2 days. A bitter taste in mouth moticeable at night and especially in the morning. It went away as soon as I had something to drink. There was no bitter taste during the daytime. Also got a yeast infection on day 8. I still have to go through 5 days of medicine. I once took it on empty stomach and got acidity 1/2 hour later. I was given Naproxen to control the inflammation and pain in my throat. I was also given Nasonex 2 puffs in each nostril daily.

I stopped everything but the antibiotic and Claritin and am doing just fine.",high
mobic,4,"mobic anti inflamatory - When I have flareups of pain, taking the meloxicam with the cyclobenzoprine and a good nights sleep would leave me pain free in the morning. Extremely lethargic the entire next day, even if I took the meloxicam by itself I am supposed to take the tablet once a day, however due to how tired I get for the entire next day, I only take as needed.  I did not figure out the problem with this drug until my son had to take it for something and he was totally wiped out as well.

I did not have the much talked about ""bad taste"" in my mouth.  I did have a ""hung over"" feeling but not often, and the feeling went away within 5 minutes of waking.

I have never noticed any side effects from taking the protonix.  I had read the list, but appear to be having no trouble. I have been taking the medication for over four years and am still taking the medication.  I only notice that when I think the reflux is under control and I stop taking it, my symptoms return with a vengence. I have had the endoscope one time and on two different occasions had the tube inserted into my nose to check the vocal chords to diagnose why I lose my voice.

After the initial 2 month honeymoon period, I felt like I was a zombie..I literally felt nothing at all, and if I was lucky enough to feel something, it would be anxiety.

Mild occasional insomnia Taken once a day it acts as a mood lifter and helps you feel full with less food.  It helped me take off a few pounds.  However, it is only a tool and patient has to be diligent about monitoring hunger and deciding to limit portions.  It's easy to ""eat around"" the drug and overeat.

Some redness and peeling around the outside of my eyes and upper lip. Caused sensitivity when using other products....night creme, serums and sunscreen. I have read that these side affects are normal and part of the skin adjusting to the retin a.....after all that is what it is supposed to do...create a chemical change in the cell which promotes cellular turnover resulting in newer, firmer skin. Daily apply about a pea size amount of the creme on my hand and sparingly apply to the orbital area, lips and forehead. I add additional creme to the back of my hands and rub vigourously ( rubbing the back of my hands together). I also apply a dime size to my neck and decollete area also rubbing, but not as vigourously.

After 3 weeks I was changed to oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily). So no more painful injections. As mentioned above I was prescibed Dilantin to avoid seizures following brain surgery. I was given dilantin injections for a period of 3 weeks while in hospital and then it changed to taking oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily)for a year. During the year I had one seizure after 6 months which happened on the night that I felt well enough to have some drinks with my friends for the first time since the operation.

chantix,1,"chantix smoking cessation - helped somewhat in minimizing the cravings and anxiety while taking it but still required substantial will power to quit.  Considering the absolute hell I went through to quit I will probably never go back to smoking. acute nausea, mental fog, vivid dreams, poor sleep quality, sore eyes, constipation, uncontrollable flatulence, euphoria, turned to dark depression, Psychosis NOS, Major Depressive Disorder, Suicidal ideation, self detrimental behaviour, emotional lability, agression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, Somatoform Disorder, Delusional Parasitosis, Cholinaergic Prurritus, Hyperacusis, Severe sleep depervation; excessive dreaming, inability to sleep deeply, feeling half awake while sleeping, waking up with sore eyes., Brain Fog, lowered inhibitions, hair roots hurting, excessive hair loss, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, inability to feel orgasm, decreased ability to maintain and achieve erections, anhedonia. I took Champix in March of '08 and I am still suffering from most of the side effects of this poisonous drug.  I started to feel some of the bad effects (nausea, mental fog, trouble sleeping, sore eyes, constipation, gas) of Champix while taking it but I was determined to quit smoking.  For the first month I felt exceptionally good and I was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and I went into a deep depression.   I was able to make it through the full 3 month course but when I stopped taking it is when I really got messed up. I developed Psychosis NOS, Major Depressive Disorder, suicidal, Emotional instability, aggression, rage, panic attacks, hallucination, Somatoform Disorder, Delusional Parasitosis (bug crawling sensations all over my body), Hyperacusis (sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound causing severe pain and pressure in my ears), Severe Insomnia, Memory Loss, Brain Fog, Lowered Inhibitions, Hair was constantly hurting all of the time and lost lots of it (27 year old male), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (started as extreme constipation and gas, fatigue, Severe Eye pain, unsightly puffy bags under eyes, excessive weight gain, gingivitis, prostate pain, black out and become out of control when drinking, decreased sexual pleasure and ability to maintain erections. I think that is everything!!! I went to the psych ward recently due to being suicidal and at a breaking point with my symptoms and I was treated like scum and given brain damaging neuroleptic (anti-psychotic) drugs against my will. I have made some small improvements since taking Champix but it looks like the nightmare will never truly end. If you are one of the many that gets burned by this medication be warned that the doctors will probably not be able to help you and will most likely deny that anything is even happening to you or that it is related to Champix and the side effects may be permanent.  I had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking Zoloft when I was younger which altered my life substantially and now Champix has put the nail in the coffin.  Apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but Pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  The medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the Champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  Many people including myself (I turned down a prescription of Zyban due to my experience with Zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and Pfizer knew that.  SHAME ON THEM FOR RUINING MY LIFE AND MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE WHOM ENDED THE MISERY BY TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE.

Other P.M. meds address various stages of sleep; clonoapem=stage 1 or quieting down mind & trazadone helps me get deep sleep of which I was totally deprived (when hGH is suppose to be released) of as revealed in sleep study.

I think I summed this up when describing treatment benefits.  But I'd like to add here that much of my daytime difficulties arise from how quickly exhaustion sets in from the mildest activity, sometimes just walking across the room. On the rare days I can get out a run local errands I come back so exhausted & in pain, it causes me to avoid doing so as much as possible.  Another issue is low blood volume-which means low oxygen available so have sudden and very high lactic acid levels from climbing a few flights of stairs or anything that demands immediate demanding effort.

tazorac,8,"tazorac anti-aging - I used this drug as an alternative to Retin A. In that regards it worked admirably.  Retin A users have a period of almost 3 months where there skin (usually face) is tremendously red.  Tazorac has little of this.  I only would only get this about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone. As above, the drug has similar side effects to Retin-A, exept for the fact that they are far less frequent and far less severe.  As above, this effect only occurred about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone. However, the results were completely worth it, as it eliminated many wrinkles in my skin, and the texture it left behind was much more cosmetically appealing. I purchased a full 60 gram tube.  It was like $10 with my insurance.  I would first wash my face with Neutogena deep facial cleaner.  After letting dry 30 minutes, I would start to apply the Tazorac.

The drug produces a feeling of being more relaxed, and in extremely high anxiety situations (flying), if I take the full dose of .5 mg, it will sleep and wake up with no residual effects.

I was also given Sudafed to help with the allergies I suffered from. Occassionally I was also given a saline solution to flush out my sinuses. The last time I was given this regimen however, I had an allergic reaction and began itching. I broke out in a rash within 45min. of taking the first dose. The doctor told us to ""keep an eye on it and if I had difficulty breathing or any other symptoms I was to rush to the ER."" Other wise he felt the symptoms to be within normal limits.

I believe the damage caused is irreversable & would somehow like to know if anyone has came across anything like this in comparison & made any recovery.

The first period I had a lot of side effects, dry mouth, have perspiration but it normalised after about 3 month. The first 3 months fear changed in almost fearless but this also normalised after 3 months. The rest of the time I used anafranil I had no side effects. I felt fine, however after 1 year I had to change physician because I moved. The new physician described Seroxat as he thought there was not only a fear issue but also a mild depression. I used Seroxat 20mg once a day for several weeks but did not feel ok�. I felt almost without any emotion. Not happy, not sad, nothing. I did not like that at all, I felt worse!! I went back to my physician and we came to a compromise. Once a day 10mg seroxat and once a day Anafranil 25mg. I used this combination for 6 months and I felt good. After 6 month I stopped the Seroxat and used the anafranil 25mg once a day for another 6 months.
I had also psychotherapy as well during these last 6 months. After that I felt ok� and stopped without any problems. I feel great now.",high
tazorac,9,"tazorac melasma - Smoother skin and even skin color are the most notable benefits. With continued use, I also noticed a greater firmness to my skin. Initial redness is common with this medication. However, this only lasts for 6 to 8 weeks. Application once daily, at night. Use of an exfoliant the next morning is recommended.",high
retin-a,8,"retin-a anti aging - The benefits I saw from Retin-A were considerable compared to non prescription skin care. The fine lines especially around my eyes and cheeks diminished and were not as deep. My entire skin tone looked younger, more even toned and my large pores were much less noticeable and more refined. My skin looked much healthier and it looked more soft focus. It took a few months to notice a measurable difference. The main side effects I had while using Retin-A were drier,flaky skin. When I started using Retin-A I started with the lower strength prescription to aviod side effects while my skin was acclimating to Retin-A. I started with Retin-A .025% strength every other night. After cleansing I wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply the Retin-A. After another 30 minutes I apply a moisturizer if needed over the Retin-A. After about 2 months I switched to the next higher strength Retin-A which is .05%. I was much more senstive to this strength so I started using it once every 3 nights to start doing the same as above, waiting 20 to 30 minutes after cleansing to apply. Once my skin tolerated this routine after about a month without flakiness I went to every other night. I now can use Retin-A .05% every night but occasionally when I start to see any dryness or skin flaking I will skip a night to give my skin a rest. I love my results. Retin-A is the only skin care I've used where I have noticed a considerable difference in the amount of sun damage that has been repaired. My skin is much more healthy looking and more refined.",high
combipatch,10,"combipatch menopause - Patient complaints prior to drug were menopause related. Inability to sleep, hot flashes, night sweats, lack of concentration (which may have been intensified by lack of sleep), loss of elasticity in the skin. Although the use of the patch has not helped improve my skin (I didn't expect it to) almost immediately sleep was restored, night sweats stopped, and concentration ability returned, although not as completely as pre-menopause. The package insert warns of serious side effects such as breast cancer, cancer of the uterus, stroke, heart attack, blood clots and dementia. I had been one determined to go through menopause without the use of any hormones. However, after trying every over the counter, holistic, and wives tale cure for 5 years with no success, I wanted RELIEF. After consulting every possible option, weighing the side effects of each one carefully, the CombiPatch was the one settled upon.  
    I am pleased to say I haven't had one side effect of the drug beyond a sticky spot left by the patch's adhesive. Granted, it has only been 6 months since beginning treatment but the benefits and quality of daily life restored have far outweighed the risks. It is, to my understanding, the smallest dosage available at 50/250 and my doctor suggested I even try applying once, rather than twice per week to see if that was enough to handle my symptoms. It was. The patch is so easy. I only have to remember once per week to change it. And on the rare occasion I forget, the patch loses some of its stickiness and reminds me! Honestly, for any woman truly suffering from constant problems like mine and don't fall into a high risk category, I would wholeheartedly recommend the patch.",high

I recently decided to get off narcotics and this is a good medicine to take.",high

Makes you tired at first and can make your body feel weird at first but that in my opinion is your body finally being able to relax. 40mg 3 times per day.",high
darvocet-n,8,"darvocet-n arthritic joint pain/carpal tunnel - affording daily movement and ability to continue to perform daily household duties, employment, and still afford me ability to enjoy activities with husband and grandchildren. Some stomach discomfort and mild queasiness but I found taking 1/2 tablets at a time with ample fluids usually alleviated problems. carpal tunnel from job related injury and arthritis degeneration of my vertebrae requires daily regimine for pain and movement. Several medications tried such as ibruprofin, allieve, demoral etc caused many unpleasent and intolerable side effects. The Darvocet taken 1/2 tablet 4-6 times daily works perfectly as nearly can be expected. I also do not experience any bothersome toxicity or effectiveness problems as I generally would afford myself time-out days allowing my system a break from routines. I believe without this medication life would be greatly less enjoyable and my abilities to participate in a positive manner would be extremely limited.",high
synthroid,10,"synthroid hashimotos syndrome - hypothyroid symptoms - Synthroid replaces the thyroid hormones not manufactured by the body. When proper levels are achieved, the endocrine system operates as it should. Important to note that generic versions CAN NOT be substituted if patient is currently treated with name brand. Start on generic, stay on generic. Start on Synthroid, stay on Synthroid. This is common knowledge among endocrinologists and pharmacists, but your insurance company may interfere.

I became more productive at work and my overall mental health improved.
It also helps a lot with my pre menstrual syndrome anxiety. I had very mild nausea about 30 minutes after taking it in the morning that went away after a couple weeks. I took the medicine 20 mg once a day for one year and had no major side effects.
Did not feel any sonolence and actually improved my sense of overall well being.",high
valtrex,10,valtrex herpes zoster - The medication stops the pain and puts an end to the condition if taken soon enough I felt fatigued but this could be just a symptom of the condition. I had little spots (blisters unbeknownst to me) on the side of my face which itched and burned terribly. This was about the size of a quarter.  I thought I had some sort of insect bite and just ignored it until it got worse and I felt so tired and sick that I went to the dr.  He took a culture but at that point he didn't think there was anything to test but prescribed Valtrex.  I took it immediately and within a day felt relief.  After a couple of days I felt a million times better.  I have had one or 2 re-occurances over the last 10 years and I make sure I always have Valtrex on hand just in case.  It is a terrible condition and I am thankful for Valtrex as it seems to stop it in its tracks.,high
adipex-p,8,"adipex-p weight loss - I've been taking for a little over a week. This med suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat and have absolutely no desire for food if I don't eat. I can already tell that I've lost inches and pounds, but I haven't been on the scale to see exactly how much yet. I have only been exercising moderately, although the feeling of energy is incredible and makes me get up and do everything!!! My doctor was cautious in giving to me because of my high blood pressure, but fortunately my BP meds have my condition well under control, so I just keep track of my daily reading to ensure there are no spikes. I feel like this really works so far! I've read the side effects, but honestly, I can't say that I've experienced more than a couple of mild headaches and feeling that slight ""elated"" feeling. I already experience night sweats & some insomnia due to menopause, so I can't tell a difference in those categories. I have a 30-day supply and based on what I've read about the addiction, I have not decided if I will continue beyond a 90-day regimen.",high

On the 3rd morning, I did not take prednisolone but went back to see the doctor as I was afraid of side effects. The doctor agreed that it was ok to stop taking the medication. None occurred while I took the medication for 2 mornings. However, it is known that prednisolone may cause osteoporosis, pigmentation, etc in the long run. I was prescribed 30mg of prednisolone (6 tablets of 5mg each) every morning for 4 mornings. However, after taking 30mg for 2 mornings, the swelling in the face reduced by about 90%. On the 3rd morning, I did not take prednisolone but went back to see the doctor as I was afraid of side effects. The doctor agreed that it was ok to stop taking the medication.",high
vivelle-dot,10,"vivelle-dot menopause - BIO estrogen is the only prescription med I take. I'm in good health other than some pesky osteoarthritis in my finger joints and hips.  I eat pretty well and keep my weight within a healthy norm (fluctuates about 10 lbs over a year back and forth depending on how hard I try). Had good blood test results about a year ago - low blood pressure, everything within the normal range for my age. The only side effects that I am aware of are the positive ones - keeping my skin from being overly dry, lack of menopausal symptoms (mostly). This patch has been a godsend for me, but I had my uterus removed in my 30s due to excessive bleeding, so I am not at risk for uterine cancer. There is no history of breast cancer in my immediate family (grandmothers/mother/sister) Started out on a .1 mg patch and worked down to a .075 patch.... doc wanted me to go lower, but when I do I get some night sweats and can tell the difference so I am staying on the .075 = my hormone levels in my blood are normal for a woman my age on HRT.",high
seroquel,1,"seroquel bipolar disorder - Well, in a technical sense it helped with the bipolar disorder, but the side effects were terrible enough that I could not continue with the medication. While taking this med, along with the others listed, I couldn't think inside of my own head. During the time I took this medication, I had no emotional reations to anything, even things that I should have. I felt like a zombie the whole time. I've been off the medication for a few years now, but from that period of time, I only have 2 memories. I took 200 mg of seroqeul in the morning and before bed; 1000 mg of depakote morning, afternoon, and night, and 10mg risperdol morning, afternoon, and night. Most of the side effects are probably becuase I should never have been taking that many medications at once and the ammount of them, but that is how they were prescribed to me.",Low

adderall-xr,4,"adderall-xr add - To treat add.  To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships. I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea. I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then, throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However, I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.",Low

After about 5 months I realized I just never got ""horny"" anymore and rarely even thought about having sex, much to my boyfriend's dismay. But my skin did look much better so I continued on. But once the relationship ended (not caused by my low desire, btw) I decided to go off of it and get a cervical cap. My sex drive returned but so did my bad skin. I am now (8 years later) giving it another go with Apri, solely for my skin b/c I really like my cervical cap, which unfortunately they stopped making.",high

It made me feel like I couldn't sit still even though I was very weak from constant vomiting. I felt like I had bugs crawling all over my legs. I also had to keep moving my legs. One pill was given by mouth with water to ease nausea and vomiting. After about 20 minutes the side effects started.,Low

None I can't live with!!!!!!!!! SLIGHT quizy stomach (and I have always taken it with food). I am to go back to orthopedic surgeon in 2 weeks (I thought I had carpal tunnel- but it was arthritis).

Not oily at all even my pores shrank and there was no acne on my face.

I have taken two tabless every day for half year.,high
topamax,8,"topamax ocd - Although Topamax is an anti-epileptic, which is more commonly perscribed for the treatment of migrains...it had a substancial benefit to my OCD symptoms.  It significantlly reduced my desire (or calling) to repeat (recheck, recount, retouch) items, which was a huge issue for me.  In the past, it would take me hours to complete the most mundane tasks, but with the Topamax, I can more easily ""let go"" of certain rituals and walk away feeling ""complete"" without having to repeat them countless times... I experienced some mild loss of appetite early on, which graduly disappaited. I statrted on 50mg, than a week later went upto 100mg. I stayed on 100mg for about a year. It wasn't until a year later that I went up to 200mg and have been on this dose for over 2 years. I experience no side effects. My mind feels quiter and I feel freeer than I ever had in my life. I am not on any other medication nor am I seeking ""talk"" therapy for my OCD. The Topamax has been able to keep it at a tolerable level.

The depression has not gotten noticeably better, and fatigue continues to be a problem. I have not noticed any side effects thus far.  I've been on the Synthroid for only 4 weeks, so it may not yet be at its full effectiveness.  I've also just found out I should take it on an empty stomach and then wait an 30 min. to and hour prior to eating for it to be 100% effective. I am taking the Synthroid to increase metabolism, stop weight gain, help with depression, and to reduce fatigue.  I have been complaining of chronic fatigue for 10 years, and the depression has been an issue for about the same length of time.  The weight gain has occurred within the last 3 years and was significant (for me) within the last two years.

Seems to work great for people with these particular problems (my sister has amenorrhea and had a horrible reaction, the never ending monthly cycle).  For me it�s life altering.  I actually kept a job for 8 years instead of two months.  I can not imaging my life without taking the depot injection.  I only wish I could learn more about why this balance of hormones actually helped with what seemed to be a debilitating mental disorder, and could slight alterations help with my depression (which I had well before I ever took this drug) I do not experience any side effects while on the depot, but if I do not take it on time, I have some mild side effects untill I recieve my injection.  I took the generic form for 6 months but noticed some undesireable changes to my mood (more anxious and irritable).  Despite the more favorable price I will never take the generic again.

I had no previous issues with depression, and as soon as I started taking this drug, I developed severe depression, and changes in my personality.  Thankfully, my family noticed a change, and advised me and told me to stop taking Zyban.  It took 2 years to overcome the depression and over 3 years to begin to feel like myself again.  Stay away from this drug!  If you want to quit smoking, butt out and stick to your guns.  I quit, and it wan't the Zyban.  I have been smoke free for 10 years, and depression free for 7 or 8.  Someone should consider a class-action suit against the company which produces this drug.  Based on other reviews I have seen, I am not the only one who had these side effects.

It is recommended by some to take an antiviral for one year after the initial outbreak so as to have less outbreaks over one's lifetime.  I did get an outbreak while on the drug, however it was during a very stressful time so that is understandable.  Also, it is nice that only one dose is needed per day for most people. Side effects included mild hair loss (had much more hair loss on acyclovir), random dry heaving (retching) for no apparent reason, and headaches.

wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl post trauma depression - Taking Wellbutrin has reduced my depression 8 fold.  I was better able to cope with every day decisions, events that stressed me with out crying or having angry episodes.  My moods have become stabilized since about a month after the start of taking this medicine. I tried two other medications prior to using Wellbutrin and was quite pleased!  I had mild dry mouth for about a month and actually lost the weight i gained from prior meds and a bit more.  I still have shaking hands but it is not any worse than a cup of coffee.  I have found that my tolerance to alcohol has increased, and lately my lower back has been hurting in the area of my kidneys, but i also have lower back spasms so i could be projecting worry that the combination of Wellbutrin and wine are doing major damage to my liver and kidneys! I started taking 150mg of Wellbutrin from April 15 to 30 in 2005 and then increased to 300mg.  I tried to take 450mg about a year ago because I felt the medicine did not seem to be working as well, but I wound up not benefiting from that dose.  I also tried to add Lexapro and gained so much weight I had to stop that medicine. I was given a generic version for about a month and I believe the pills were expired or tainted because the smelled rancid and my behavior patterns went haywire!",high

Tried to stop taking 1 mg of Ativan per day after 10 days and had horrible withdrawal symptoms including blurred vision, shakiness, weakness, heightened sense of smell, nausea. Sick as a dog.

The brown spots would be less noticable as long as I was using the cream consistantly. dry peeling skin, redness. once you stopped using it the blotchiness returned and brown spots returned. I needed to wear alot of sunscreen on my hand after using it on that area because it rendered those areas vulnerable to sun exposure. also while driving I had to wear gloves which blocked sun rays to my hands. used from a tube mainly at night. Used a pea size amount on each hand and one pea size amount on the face. Used over the lip line and on fine lines under the eye.",high

My energy level has sky rocketed and my ability to be mentally focused is much better. My TSH went from 6.29 to .6. My T3 and T4 uptake are within the normal ranges. I did not have any treatment side effects. I went in for a routine check up and mentioned feeling tired and anxious and asked if I could have my hormone levels checked. It turned out that I had hypothyroidism. I was given a choice of Synthroid or Armour thyroid. Based on everything that I had read I wanted to try the Armour. I started on 30 mg. and after about 6 months increased to 45 mg. Every 3-6 months I've had blood work and my TSH level has steadily dropped each time to my current level of .6. I feel better than I have in years. The difference in my mental outlook and energy is incredible. I also avoid soy products, products with fluoride and wait about 2 hours before eating after I take my medicine because I have read that doing these things are beneficial in making the treatment more effective.",high
adipex-p,8,"adipex-p weight loss - I have always tried to lose 20-30 pounds and had no luck.  A friend of mine used Adipex (Phentermine) and lost 40 pounds in 4 months so I had to try it.  I started taking it last October 08 and by Christmas I had to buy all new pants because my other ones were WAY too big.  Total I lost 25 pounds and am now 130. I just started taking it again after being off of it for 3 months because I didnt want to get too addicted which I know you can from this drug, and you also build up an immunity to it, which I also did. Overall though, it definitely works to loose weight, my sister-in-law, my best friend, and my sister all took it and my sister lost the least so far(only been on it for 1 month) with 15 pounds. Bad trouble sleeping. WIll fall asleep after a little trouble, but cannot stay asleep, wake up several times a night unable to get good rest. Have to take sleep aide with this drug or wont sleep at all! Also have bad to mild headache for first week or so, goes away after a while.  Mood swings are absolutely noticable, ups and downs. I NEVER noticed where my appetite was decreased at all, actually makes my stomache growl about 1/2 hour after taking it, nor did I have any extra energy ever, although somehow I DID lose weight on this pill. I take 1/2 pill in morning before breakfast and other 1/2 lunch time.",high
tazorac,6,"tazorac acne - I noticed a significant improvement in my acne. I had painfully dry, irritated, and red skin for several months, as well as higher susceptibility to sunburn and visibly peeling, flaky skin... those first few months were the worst period of treatment. After a while, however, all the symptoms except for the peeling skin and sun sensitivity diminished. I applied a pea-sized amount of Tazorac cream once a night before bed, starting in my freshmen year in high school. I've been using Tazorac ever since (five years or so) because of the positive skin effects it's supposed to have.",high
lamisil,10,"lamisil toe-nail fungus - Although it is essential to take the medication for the full 90 days, after one week I noticed that the skin on my affected foot was looking much better. I had years of tough, thick, dry, flaky skin on my heel and pads under my toes. As each week passed, this condition continued to improve. Almost from day one I did not experience any itchy toes or feet. At the end of the 90 days, I could see healthy nails growing up from the cuticle, although it will take several more months for the entire toe-nail on each affected toe to grow long enough that I can cut away the damaged nail. The first few days (maybe three)of taking the drug I was a bit headachy and then experienced some mild stomach upset. After that, I was fine with no further issues.
A positive side effect was that after the treatment was over I noticed that the skin on my legs was very smooth. Previously I had rough, scaly skin which I just thought was dry skin, though I could never rid myself of it. But I guess it was part of the whole problem because now the skin is beautiful. I had been having regular doctor check-ups and am healthy.

During the 90 days, I was told to take the drug once per day and to also use lamisil cream on my feet every day.
About mid-way through, the doctor ordered a test for my liver, which came out fine.
Once the treatment was complete, my doctor suggested that I take one pill every month and use the cream on my feet twice per week.",high
effexor-xr,8,"effexor-xr mild to moderate depression - Improved mood after trying several other SSRI's. Had tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and got no effect from them. I was able to function better. I was not ecstatic, but was functional and less prone to negative thinking. a bit of feeling dull or neutral. Maximum dosage indicated in literature is 150 mg per day.  Took two 75 mg capsules in the morning with breakfast. The medication started to work within two or three days.  However, it's expensive. I would not say that I am non-functional without it, but I believe I am more functional when taking it.",high
retin-a,9,"retin-a acne/dull skin - Cleared up my acne and brightened my skin overall; slightly reduced fine lines.  Aside from acne, it seemed to help my skin in general.  This is by far the best acne treatment I've used.  Now I use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne). Thinning of skin leaves more sun sensitivity. Also, it cleared my acne, but didn't seem to ""treat"" it - if I stop using it, my acne comes back within a few weeks. Very easy - simply applied a pea-sized amount every other night before bed.",high
paxil,8,"paxil panic attacks - I have been on Paxil or generics for 9 years after a life-time of panic attacks. My attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. Even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment I would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. As a few others have noted, the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. Paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. I am a calmer and more socially comfortable person. Lots of side effects, none of them deal breakers. It took months to achieve orgasm - it was like having a dead weight between my legs. Having reduced treatment to 10mgs a few years ago that has improved. As many others report, wild dreams and less deep sleep is now the norm but I have long grown accustomed to it. Miss a dose and you get those weird 'electric' buzz shocls in your brain - a tad alarming but not horrible. Weight increase of about 10 pounds - very difficult to get rid of. Started at 10 mg on doctor's recommendation, went to 20 after a month. Noticable improvement in mood and lessened anxiety. After 4-5 years weaned myself down to 10 mg by cutting the pills. With doctor ok have stayed at 210 for the last 6 years. Once i tried to reduce it to 5 mg - big mistake. Too big a jump and had terrible anxiety. Decided I could live with 10 mg. It works, but with side effects. Like all powerful medicine, it's a tradeoff. For me it is still worth it 10 years later.",high

acyclovir,10,"acyclovir hsv1 - Immediately ameliorated symptoms and extremely efficacious when used prophylactically Occasional mild gastrointestinal irritation when using a high dose (4000 mg) I take 800 mg of acyclovir at the first sign of tingling along lips or tip of nose. I've found this prophylactic approach to be most efficacious if I dose at 800 mg for a day or two subsequently. In doing so, I've reduced hsv1 outbreaks from one a month to one a year. If I do get an outbreak, I dose 4000 mg per day (800 mg apprx every 2-3 waking hours) for four days then taper to 800 to 1600 mg per day for two to three more days with excellent results. If I begin dose after an outbreak has initiated, it is immediately arrested from worsening though it still will go through it's viral cycle remaining at a very small scale as long as I continue treatment as described above.",high

seasonique,1,"seasonique to prevent pregnancy - 4 periods a year The first week that I took this pill, I felt like I had the flu.  I had to take a sick day off from work because I felt so sick: headache, constantly feeling hot and cold, extreme tiredness.  I also started breaking out a lot and my skin started to be so dry.  My husband also has said that I've had some mood swings as well. I stopped taking the pills today.  I hope this will stop all the symptoms.  I will probably never take any birth control for the rest of my life.  I was on Depo for about 2 years, which was fine--no major side effects except for the decreased sex drive.  I was on Ortho Tri Cyclen for about a year before Depo, but I stopped because I definitely got lighter periods but the periods were longer (5 days) than when I was not on any BC (3 days).
I shouldn't have been on any BC to begin with.  Afterall, I shouldn't complain--my periods are always on time like clock work.  No cramps, only the occasional bloating.  I started to be on BC to prevent pregnancy, but I'll just be more careful by using a condom instead.",Low

I was also receiving the physical therapy for my wrist pain, which was from work related injury.(repetitive overuse). The pain killer was to help with the pain from just moving my hands.",Low
topamax,9,"topamax depression/binge eating - With the Topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. It was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and I just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. Not that food didn't taste good, or I wasn't hungry, I just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss. Dry mouth (I was also taking Prozac at the time which definitely contributed), mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles), I've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with Topamax (i.e. dopamax), they forget words easily, have trouble spelling, feel foggy, etc... I guess I'm one of the few fortunate people whom Topamax doesn't effect that way. Either that, or the dose I'm at (200 mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. Many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to 1200mg. I had done some research on Topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines, and it was only FDA approved for epilepsy. While on the web I found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes, such as an add-on to an SSRI that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients, a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder. Several convincing clinical studies have been done in all of the above categories as well. Topamax will have clearance from the FDA to be marketed for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 2010.",high

trazodone,10,"trazodone sleeplessness associated with depression - It helped me sleep, which at the time was miraculous. Bad taste in mouth but the sleep was worth it. If I could tell I was going to have a hard time sleeping, I was supposed to take the medecine about 45 minutes before going to bed.  Sometimes it was hard to realize/remember to take it ahead of time like that, but it was so fast-acting that wasn't really a problem.  I'm little, 5'2 and 120 lbs, and the doctor said it was okay to break them in half so I mostly did.  After about fifteen minutes I would get drowsy and then I would get a nice night's sleep.   This was incredibly valuable and it was no problem to go off the medication at the end of treatment because I was only taking it when I needed it anyway, only a couple times a week at the worst point.  The halitosis might have actually made it easier to stop taking--I had to really want the sleep and be willing to put up with the foul taste in my mouth. But if I needed the sleep badly enough it was really worth it.",high
desyrel,9,"desyrel sleeplessness - effective for falling and staying asleep slight dry mouth initially, but this subsided with use (3 - 4 weeks) My problem was never falling asleep, it was waking up a few hours after falling asleep and being wide awake, my mind racing on thoughts of the day.  This medicine allowed me to fall asleep quickly and stay sleeping throughout the night.  My doctor told me it was originally marketed for anxiety/depression, but not widely prescribed for that once the sedative effects became known.  (I can't imagine taking one of these in the morning, as a anti-depressant....It would surely knock me out.)  The tablets are sold as 150 mg tablets.

avita,7,"avita acne - The benefits of using Tretinoin were great. First of all I noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. But I had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. Continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter. luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it. My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.",high

when i first started i had alot of nausea, but after a few months it was better. When i first started going to the methadone clinic, i had to go there withdrawing.  I had to take a physical and a drug test when i started.  You can fail the first test, because they know you would have drugs in your system.  I had to pay $154 when i first started and i pay almost $400 a month, which equals out to be $13.50 a day.

I get drug tested every month and i have passed so many that i get ""take homes"".  I only have to go there once a month now and i have to see my counslor for an hour each month and get drug tested.  I get called in for random drug testing.  I have to bring my bottles in so they will know that they are ""straight"" so they know i am not selling them.  They do that to everyone.  

I have been there for seven years now and i am 26 years old.  WHen i first started, i had to drive 1 1/2 hours a day for seven days a week for three months and then i got one take home.

xyrem,3,"xyrem sleep disorders - I ahve three sleep disorders: sleep apnea due to closing up of my throat (anatomical), restless leg syndrome and the worst one, hypersomnia -- tired much of the time with no explanation. I tried this drug - sent directly to the home and only with approved diagnosis (I am just short of narcolepsy) - to see if I would feel rested when I awoke. I did for one day but then the effects did not continue with each successive night. Sounds strange, I know, but that is what happened. I did not have any side effects except that if I got less than 4 1/2 hours of sleep after waking to take the second dose - I would stillfeel the effects -- as if drugged a bit. I think I have included everything above. I tried a second week and felt a slight refreshed feeling upon awakening - but not significant ewnough to keep taking it. Understand, I only remember awakening refreshed 3 times in my life. one of them after that first night I used Xyrem.

wellbutrin-xl,8,"wellbutrin-xl depression - Wellbutrin XL was the only anti-depressant I tried that I could take without noticable side effects. A big contributer to my depression was weight gain that accompanied it, and as a result my doctor prescribed wellbutrin because typically the patient either stays the same or loses weight will taking it, as opposed to almost every other anti-depressent which can cause weight gain. Very minimal side effects. Only noticable thing is that you can feel the pill wear off near bed time and that can cause a sudden spike in appetite. The wellbutrin helped me regain control of my appetite and as a result i took back control of my happiness and wellbeing.",high

zocor,5,"zocor high blood cholesterol - The drug did lower the blood cholesterol effectively. The side effects included nightmares, muscle weakness, dizziness. 
In addition there were emotional disturbances. The drug was prescribed by a Cardiologist and was effective, however the side effects were considerable. After approximately one year the cholesterol LDL did drop and although this was positive, the side effects continued. After two years, the dosage was reduced to alternative days at the same daily dose. If the cholesterol level remains normal, with the adjustment of diet and exercise, the plan is to further reduce the drug over time.",high

remeron,10,"remeron greater depression - Depression has cleared up quite miraculously. Eating too much - no sense of when to stop. Slight antihistamine feel. I had been on Celexa for two years, and noticed a major change in my libidio and concurrent diminishment of feeling in my sexual parts.  As I am married I started taking Cialis to maintain an erection, and it worked fine, however, Cialis didn't make me feel any more during lovemaking, and the whole topic increased my depression and worry. I didn't wish my wife to find out I took Cialis because I love her dearly and didn't want her to think my sexual feelings were drug induced.  

I searched the internet for non-SSRI antidepressants with little or no sexual side effects.  I talked to my psychiatrist about Mirtazapine and he was fine with taperinf me off of the Citalopram. Within days of decreasing the Citalopram I felt so much smarter. The Mirtazapine has really allayed the depression and most of my anxiety.  I do also take Buproprion and the two things do seem to allay depression and anxiety.

I definitely recommend trying Mirtazapine if you're depressed, especially if you either hate SSRIs, or haven't founnd anything else which works. It doesn't really have such bad side effects. And my dreaming has become really interesting. I actually can't wait to go to bed now.  I did have a nightmare the first night I took it, but not since then. Instead I have had all sorts of dream desire fulfillment, and it's odd how much that can make you feel more resourceful for the rest of your day.

I also wasn't able to work for the last two years because of moodiness and benzodiazpine use for anxiety and sleep.  Now I have cut out all thosoe medications and I really do feel much better.

tylenol-with-codeine,1,"tylenol-with-codeine pain after minor surgery - Due to extensive varicose veins, I was in pain, especially when standing. They were physically embarassing and I could not even wear sheer pantyhose. The surgery would eliminate pain and the ugliness.   I was told to take the drug before surgery to minimize swelling and to minimize pain. I do not like to introduce drugs into my body unless an emergency so I did not take it before the surgery, instead opting for Bromelain enzyme, ginger and tumeric to reduce swelling. The side effects after the surgery were swelling and pain and possibly infection at the incision sites. About 10 hours post surgery, the pain became unbearable, and I decided to take one dose of acetaminophen w/codeine #3.  When I got up a couple of hours later to go and use the bathroom, I passed out in the bathroom. Lucky for me, my husband was nearby.

climara,1,"climara hormone replacement therapy - no positive benefits mood changes, weight gain (4 pounds in 3 days!) extremely emotional. depression I had been using the trade brand of this patch, Climara for several months with positive results.  One month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because I was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation, I agreed, thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  To begin with, the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (I laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed, but soon it wasn't so funny.)  Within a day or two I knew something was wrong, but hadn't yet identified the problem.  I couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  It seemed as if overnight, my world had become very sad and depressing. I immediately began to gain weight, despite no change in my dietary habits.  After finally putting two and two together, I ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  After rechecking my prescription, the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked ""no generics"".  Apparently, he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  The pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal.

neurontin,8,"neurontin nerve pain - great skin sensitivity - The benefits are that being on Neurontin with the Lidoderm Patch 5%, it has helped to give me a much better quality of life.  My pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications, though not completely gone.  The side effects, to my knowledge, have been minimal, especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  Could a different medication work better?  Maybe. It's hard to say what the side effects might be.  I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However, I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...). Ten years ago I had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  Fortunately it was benign.  The down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  The greatest nerve pain I have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  The skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  I have been very happy with Neurotin for the most part.  I know it is working because if I am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  The Neurotin alone does not work well.  In addition, I have to wear a Lidoderm patch.  This has made a huge difference.  Now, after nine years I'm beginning to feel my medication isn't working as well as it used to and am planning to review these changes with my doctor.",high

ultram,8,"ultram hand pain - Since I tried to avoid the GI effect of Motrin, or celebrex if used too long, the tramadol seemed a good alterntive.  I took it in the morning, and it generally seemed to energize me enough so that I stayed active, and if it didn't relieve the pain, It seemed to keep me from thinking about it and I remained busy. I did find that if I took it in the late afternoon, I really   couldn't sleep at night, mymind raed and I felt unsettled.   It reduced my appetite a bit, ad I would work without eating, or drinking.  Had to remind myself to eat. I have degenerative joint desease in both my hands.  Took the standrd painkillers, not narcotics, but asa, tylenol, motrin, and then Celebrex.  The best was celebrex, but there is a danger with taking it long term.  Ultram ws prescribed at first as 50mg twice a day.  This wasn't at all effective.  So we upped the dose, and this worked well, except not at night. Since then I hae had boththumb joints replaced, and althoughI still have a prescription for the Ultram, I rarely use it... sometimes for back aches.  Someone once told me it is an opiate derivative.  If so, it does not seem to have an addictive quality, or any withdrawal symptoms, at least not the way I have used it.",high
provigil,1,"provigil daytime sleepiness - Virtually nil. PLEASE< PLEASE read on.... If you take a look at the side effects the FDA requires Provigil manufacturer Cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is ""vasodilatation""?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

After 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session. My ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""I'm in"", the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right).",Low

valtrex,9,valtrex herpes - It drastically reduced breakouts all over my body therefore I did not constantly have flu like symptoms because of the breakouts. So even under stressful life events which usually results with a breakout the Valtrax stopped or reduced the frequency of breakouts. So far I have only been taking 1 per day and I have not had any breakouts for a month. It initially made me feel tired and lethargic. I believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. I think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. Since I am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem. I was supposed to take 2 tablets a day 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. I followed this regimen for 1 and a half weeks then I decided to reduce the dosage myself to 1 per day. I checked with the ND and she said that protocol could be followed unless I felt that I was going to have a breakout then go back to 2 a day. I can take up to 4 per day if needed however so far the 1 per day has worked well for me.,high

My balance has been off, I am extremely tired all day, there is a bad taste in my mouth which alters the taste of food. My mouth is so dry that I drink non-stop and cough a lot. What made me decide to quit this drug before the month trial is the fact that I have this really bad memory loss.  I forget where I live, my dog's name, my employees' names.  I would look at a steak and not remember what it was called.  I would stare blankly.  My job is detail oriented and I could not concentrate. I am supposed to take 50 mg a day.  I was told to take 1/2 in morning and 1/2 at bedtime or 50 mg at bedtime or 50 mg in the morning.  Whatever works.  There are so many side effects that the good night sleep will have to be given up.

synthroid,1,"synthroid low thyroid - The synthroid medication did, for most of the ten years while I took it, keep my thyroid levels where they were supposed to be. After taking this synthroid medication for a period of about 10 years, here is what happened.  We were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden I began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak, with a rapid heart beat.  We were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  So I thought if I can just get to my home town and get to a hospital, they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  We arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room, where they ran several tests and I was there for several hours, but they could find nothing wrong with me.  So they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day, which I did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems. I was able to find an osteopathic doctor who put me on a natural thyroid, not a synthetic, he calld it a dessicated thyroid which came from an animal source, so I was able to get off the synthetic.  Then after being on that for a while, he was able to get me off of that and I took a natural supplement, L- tyrosine

avita,7,"avita acne - The benefits of using Tretinoin were great. First of all I noticed that my skin started glowing and my acne diminished greatly. But I had to be very patient because the results were not immediate. Continued use of the medicine rendered amazing results. My skin is a lot more smoother, healthier, and brighter. luckily I did not notice any negative side effects. The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it. My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.",high

valium,10,"valium migraines, back spasm, insomnia - I have found Valium to be a godsend. It helps stave off migraine attacks, it helps me get to sleep when I have insomnia, and it relaxes  the muscles in my back when I get spasms. I use it sparingly, only when I really need it, (about 2-3 times a week ) and I have not found it to be addictive at all. I actually find it to be relatively mild, and I think it's over-regulated. I don't have any side effects from taking it. My migraine attacks are directly related to muscle spasms that occur in my lower intestine. My doctor called it an ""abdominal migraine."" If I take a Valium when I feel a migraine coming on, it often goes away without having to take a Maxalt. I've had a mastectomy, chemo & radiation, and have been through a lot of anxiety, but I don't rely on Valium as an anti-anxiety drug. I'd be eating them like candy if I did, and then I probably would get addicted. I think Valium should be considered more of a muscle relaxant. That's how I use it, anyway.",high

Although steroids are being scrutinized in the media at this time, they do have a place in the treatment of life threatening episodes of asthma and other diseases that casue severe inflammation.  I do not care to be on prednisone for any period of time, however, breathing is necessary to life and the prednisone offers a quick relief of the symptoms. While taking the prednisone I had an increase in blood pressure.  I also was very perspired while the dose was higher and felt extremely edgy and agitated. The prednisone was prescribed for a rebound effect after an anaphylactic reaction.  While at the ER I was given solumedrol and benadryl.  Since I have asthma, a prednisone taper was prescribed in the event that a rebound effect occured, which it did.  I began the taper immediately upon the worsening of symptoms.  It took about 3 hours for the prednisone to begin working.  During that time, there was a back and forth response from my body as it fought the prednisone for control.  During this event, I learned that I will always use my Epipen in the future as adrenalin is not always part of the protocol at the ER.  The adrenalin stops the initial reaction and may prevent the need for the prednisone later.",high

Ever since I've been on advair, I no longer need albuterol.  My breathing is stronger according to doctors and I enjoy exercise without having breathing complications.

The was some redness and skin warming, but those side effects were tolerable. I had an allergic reaction when used with benzoyl peroxide. My pores became enlarged, and were plugged with blackheads. My research found that when used with benzoyl peroxide, staining and pore enlargement might be a side effect, which I did suffer. I was prescribed hydroquinone to lighten/even my skin tone prior to laser treatment of scarring due to acne. About two days in to the treatment, I noticed the pore enlargement and staining. After 10 days, I discontinued the treatment due to the side effects.",Low

I can work more efficiently now, can get through my day without feeling like I need to lie down on the floor and sleep! I notice that if I drink caffeinated beverages I get way too jittery, whereas I used to use coffee and diet caffeinated drinks to keep my energy level up and they wouldn't bother me by making me too hyper.  So I have to stay away from those.  Also, if I take a dose too late in the day, I stay up too late! I have fibromyalgia, and was having a hard time with the high fatigue levels and difficulty concentrating.  At first I just took Wellbutrin to help with these things, but a doctor suggested trying Ritalin for better results.  It does work much better than the Wellbutrin for these symptoms.",high

concerta,8,"concerta add - My son had a definite and rather dramatic increase in his ability to focus at school, complete his homework and we even saw a difference in his sports performance.  He went from grades averaging C's, with some lower, to A & B's for most classes within just a couple of months.  Even his teachers were very impressed with the difference, and my son's confidence improved tremendously. The side effects have been very mild. At some points he seems more argumentative and high strung, but not most of the time.  Generally this medication has been well tolerated.  We do not administer the medication on the weekends or when he is not at school (during school breaks or during the summer). The treatment with Concerta is simple - he takes  one pill a day during the school week.  We have semi-annual visits with the Dr. to check on his progress.  While starting the medication, we had to adjust the dosage slowly upward.  But he had maintained the current dose for more than 1.5 years now with good affects.",high
oxazepam,8,"oxazepam insomnia - This drug helped me to be able to fall sleep during an extremely stressful period in my life when I simply could not fall asleep.  I had tried many herbal sleep remedies, homeopathics, melatonin supplements, acupuncture and so forth, but the Serax was the only thing that helped me.  Initially during treatment I would be able to sleep 4-6 hours which was a huge benefit to me as I was exhausted from insomnia and stress. Sometimes I would feel a slight tension in my head the next morning, but this was better than total exhaustion from sleeplessness.  More recently I find that on the rare occasions that I use Serax, I wake up with a headache if I take a full capsule.  I find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache. My doctor tried various antidepressant type sleep medications to help me to sleep but they did not help at all.  They left me feeling groggy and with a strange disconnected feeling.   We also tried Ambien but this only helped me get about 2 hours of sleep and then I'd wake up and feel strange.  The Serax worked for me to help me fall asleep when I couldn't sleep, and to stay asleep for 4-6 hours.  Also there were hardly any side effects except for the slight headache.  I had no trouble going off the medication during the times when I no longer needed it.  Sometimes I would taper from 1 capsule to 1/2 capsule per night, or one night on and one night off the medication, but most times I simply stopped using it when I no longer needed it.   I still use a half a capsule occasionally when I travel if I have trouble falling asleep.",high

zomig,7,"zomig migraine - The benefits of taking Zomig are suppression of migraine/headache pain for at least 12-24 hours.  Sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack. The side effects of taking Zomig for me are inability to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake. I can take Zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  The sooner I  take it the faster it works.  If I take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but I have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  If I take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  It also makes me feel very foggy and I cannot drive. Sometimes I have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  Sometimes if I catch the headache early enough and go to bed I can cut the dose in half and it still works.  It's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. If I wait too long to take it, nausea sets in and I cannot keep the medication down.  Then I need to take the sublingual dose, which I don't like to purchase because I can't divide the doses at all.  
I am very happy to have a medicine that alleviates the extreme migraine pain but I wish it didn't make me so drowsy because that still cuts into my productivity.",high
geodon,10,"geodon bi-polar disorder - The benefits are numerous. With the Geodon I haven't suffered from a bout of depression in app. 2 1/2 yrs.. Before the Geodon I suffered from depression for months at a time. I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away. The side effects are: dry mouth, possible headache, The treatment for me is to take 2 80mg capsules of Geodon daily and follow up with a psychiatrist.",high
wellbutrin-xl,7,"wellbutrin-xl anxiety and depression - The best , BEST thing about Wellbutrin is that I have my sex drive back fully and I am realizing how much I missed it. That has been fantastic. I have noticed some appetite suppression too, which seems to sort of come and go, but it's definitely a welcome side effect. I have been able to get A LOT done at work, which is never a bad thing, but it's also unpredictable thus far. I also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness I would experience if I missed a dose of Zoloft. I'm still sorting out the side effects. I keep having waves of anxiety and depression interspersed with days of feeling great. I have noticed I'm more quick to anger, which isn't really all that bad. Makes me realize I'm FEELING things fully. I have had some difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite, sometimes good, sometimes a little alarming. I decided that I wanted to go off Zoloft because, while on it, I still experienced some depressive episodes and a terrible loss of libido. I felt out of control and wanted to reclaim that part of myself so I tapered slowly off of Zoloft... which was very difficult, as it can make one very very sick, with flu-like symptoms. While tapering off I began taking the 150 mg dose of Wellbutrin. I still don't feel 100% treated, if one ever can, but I am happy to have myself back, even if I'm not always as good as I want to be!",high

effexor,4,"effexor depression - While taking Effexor at the 37.5mg dose, I have noticed some improvement in my mood stability throughout the morning.  I felt less anxious during the day, but anxiety creeps in again towards the night.  Although I felt MUCH happier and more like my ""old"" self on the higher dose, the 37.5mg dose allowed me to sleep the night, which was not possible at the higher dose. Upset stomach was common if I forgot to take it with food. My doctor prescribed due to depression and anxiety.  As mentioned above, I felt so much better on the higher dose (75mg?)... but was unable to sleep at night for several weeks on this dose.  Therefore, I began again at the lower (37.5mg) dose (after trying a few other antidrepressants).  Overall, I am currently unhappy with the effects of the lower dose.",Low

Wonder drug where I've never had to increase the dosage for same effect over 18 years. Annoyance of having to call doctor for refills and go to pharmacy for 18 years 75mg. before bedtime and I sleet thru the night every night for 18 years. Once in a while I would forget to take it and not know that until I woke early and concerned why it was'nt working that night, but next morning I would see the 1/2 pill still on the table with a glass of water. To me it was the best unintended test of whether I still needed it, I did.",high
provigil,8,"provigil central sleep apnea related fatigue - Provided increased alertness and perceived cognitive enhancement. Helped me maintain focus and motivation at work. I still drank coffee throughout the day but it was significantly less with Provigil. Prior to Provigil I was prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. which really had a negative effect on my duty performance. I had TOO much energy and jitters and could not focus on anything for more than 5 minutes. The opposite of what it was prescribed for. I began having stomach troubles with this drug. I now take Prilosec and Pepcid to counter this. Worth it? Sometimes. Like other reviews here, I found that the positive effects did wear off by the end of the day and dosing again is not smart if you want to get any sleep at all. In addition, I notice increased heart rate at times and seems to exacerbate the frequency and strength of my PVCs. I do like the increased alertness and cognitive enhancement but not sure how Provigil is effecting my heart in the long term.",high

As if that wasn't enough fun I experienced shortness of breath, too. Now when I have a panic attack I take 1/2 of a 1 mg pill and within minutes I am calm and focused. Mild drowsiness, which is ok if you are somewhere stationary. However, my first attack happened on a busy freeway in rush hour traffic. That is not a great time to be drowsy. But thankfully I only need 1/2 of the pill and so far I haven't had any more attacks while driving. My doctor prescribed ten 1 mg tablets to take on an as needed basis.

After a longer period, I got freaked out by the idea, not good for a married woman. Still I didn't associate it with Zoloft. I spoke with a friend who had taken Zoloft as well, and she stated that she was 'running' from her husband regarding sex and changed meds. I also requested a change to another anti-depressant and no longer have a libido problem. I was suffering from clinical depression that manifested itself as overall crankiness, irritability and sore, aching muscles in my shoulders and neck. My doctor prescribed muscle relaxers and x-rayed my neck. No problems. I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed depression. I was given Zoloft and the irritability and muscle aches went away very quickly.",high
omnicef,2,"omnicef ear infection - I had to stop the medicine because of the side effects and he got sicker (I know you aren't supposed to stop antibiotics for this exact reason).  He ended up on another antibiotic that worked well. He's one year old, and his mood changed drastically.  He became agressive and mean.  Clenching his fists, growling, hitting his sister and pulling her hair and being totally uncooperative were our everyday behaviors.  He is normally a laid back, sweet child.  The pediatrition disagrees and says it wasn't the medicine, but I know it was. He was supposed to take it for 10 days, but the behavior was out of control, so the pediatrition told me to stop it for 24 hours and see if the behavior changed.  I stopped on day 7 and within 18 hours, he started to improve- within 24 hours he was almost back to normal.  The pediatrition and pharmacist both say that it doesn't go to the brain, and therefore can't cause behavior changes, but SOMETHING in that drug definitely effected him.  I know my child and I watched him very carefully, I KNOW it was the antibiotic.  I won't be using it again for either of my children.",Low

There were also a couple instances of loss of cognitive reasoning, which was most frightening. I had total dental implants, which involved removing my existing deteriorating teeth (full set) and then placing first, temporary titanium posts into my upper and lower jaws and then permanent posts. A series of temporary acrylic ""teeth"" were fashioned to fit onto the temporary and permanent posts until my gums healed. Then permanent porcelain teeth were attached to the implant posts.",Low
zoloft,10,"zoloft depression, clinical level - it gave me back my life. Since taking this my brain chemicals are balanced. Several times I have tapered down and twice, off, and the effects have been terrible. For me, I have a depression that cycles me into such a deep dark place that it is terrifying. I was suicidal and had great despair. THe only thing that changed was taking this medication. I know it does't work for everyone but for me, it waas and continues to be a lifesaver. I am very very thankful everyday. It takes a few weeks for your brain to become right. I would have a flash of vertigo now and then, but that's it. Nothing else.My body is obviously not able to make the amount of seritonin required. It is genetic. I began on the tiniest amount, 50 mg. once a day. It was not at all effective. I was upped to 100 mg. daily and that made a difference. Afer about 6 months, at my request, the dosage was upped to 150mg. daily. This held me for 7 years. Then I crashed again. The doctor upped it to 200 mg., taking 150mg in the morning and 50mg at bedtime. This has worked for me for many years. 
Once you pull out of a depression, which is a very physical thing for me, and you can experience a life that is not defined by how gray to black it is, it is humbling. I can now experience tasting food, having a sex life, feeling joy, and actually bound out of bed. My energy is normal. 
Anyone who claims that they pop antidepressants for kicks as if they were uppers or downers has got to be making it up. If you have ever experienced true clinical level depression and then had the gift of taking this medication and for the first time really having a life like everybody else,  you would never ever abuse it. It is so precious to feel normal for the first time. I will take this medication for the rest of my life.

This scared me because i thought i was having an intense allergic reaction to the drug. Then, there was a lot of pressure in my head so i then took an Aleve and that pretty much eased everything out.

vesicare,10,"vesicare overactive bladder - Urinary frequency and urgency have been substantially reduced; I have a vastly improved lifestyle because these problems no longer inhibit my activities. I experienced mild constipation in the beginning but because I eat a vegetarian diet I have been able to manage this side effect easily by increasing dietary fiber.  No other measures have been necessary. My gynecologist changed me to Vesicare when I complained about side effects from the previous Rx I was on for overactive bladder.  (These were dry mouth and constipation.)  After beginning to take Vesicare daily, I noticed an immediate improvement, i.e., sharp decrease in the negative side effects.  I plan to continue the use of Vesicare because there seem to be no prohibitions to its long term use.  It may also possibly postpone surgical repair of the pelvic prolapse.",high
paxil-cr,8,"paxil-cr anxiety/ibs - Significantly and quickly reduced anxiety (within 2 weeks). In turn, digestive problems (IBS) related to anxiety were significantly improved. Greatly improved my quality of life. As long as treatment was taken consistently, side effects were minimal. This medication does not seem to mix well with alcohol - memory loss and increased intoxication were experienced when alcohol was consumed. If a dosage was missed, side effects included unpleasant sensory experiences (like electrical sparks, ""zapping""), dizziness, and disorientation. A strong cautionary statement: withdrawal from this medication may be extremely unpleasant. The overall experience I had with this drug was diminished only by the harsh symptoms associated with discontinuing the drug. The effects included heightened irritability, and strong sensory effects described previously. The drug dosage should be tapered; I quit taking the drug ""cold turkey"" and in retrospect it was a poor choice. I estimate that it took a couple months to stop experiencing the withdrawal symptoms. A single 10 mg dose was taken daily. I logged my progress by journaling my emotional and physical state at various points in the treatment.",high

I watch my diet carefully and take omega 3 but it has not lowered my cholesterol sufficiently. There were no side effects that I am aware of. My husband has now also begun treatment after trying diet only. When first given the simvastatin, my doctor had me take it only every other day and after 2-3 months my blood tests were fine. Later, when I moved and changed doctors, I was told that one cannot take it any less than daily and so that is what I now do.

xenical,10,"xenical obesity - Cholesterol went from 265 to 199.  Lost 32 lbs. in 3 months. One incident of an oily stool. I took part in a 3-month Obesity/Binge Eating study back in 2004 which included the use of a Placebo or Orlistat (Xenical) conducted by a local Hospital/Medical Center. I would meet with the doctor's weekly and was put on a low-fat diet and asked to do moderate exercise of 30-40 minutes 3 days a week during this study. At the time I was Age 39, 5 ft 7 and 200 lbs. and a cholesterol level of 265 (you had to have a BMI of 30 percent in order to participate in study, and I just made it per the weight and height chart). Half of the study participants were put on a placebo pill and half were put on Orlistat (Xenical). They did not tell the participants during the study if they had the placebo or if they had the Orlistat. At the end of the 3 month study, I lost 32 lbs. (down to 168 lbs.) and my cholesterol went from 265 to 199. I was told at that time I was taking Orlistat. The participants who took Orlistat lost more weight than the ones who took placebo and did the low-fat diet. I can only remember once having what may have been an oily stool. I never had cramps, diarrhea or any type of bowel accidents. It is now 2010, and I have put on 20 lbs. since. I am considering trying to get my family doctor to prescribe Orlistat. I have not heard anything negative about the medication, except for the side effects of oily stools, etc. I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) and continue to take the Orlistat. If you follow the directions, you are to eat low-fat and also take a multi-vitamin. I look forward to trying out the Orlistat again. :)",high

xanax,5,"xanax bipolar disorder/panic attacks - There were some good benefits, such as it would relax me and was able to get a good nights sleep.I felt more confident when taking this drug as it dulls your senses and changes everything into a positive.After a couple of months I became dependant on xanax as it made me feel good about myself. There are many side effects that I experienced at different times.The worst side effect was that I would go into a rage and yell at my partner for the littlest things.Even though I was aware how bad I was,the anger inside of me took over and there wasn't any control.The morning dose always made me tired for the rest of the day, so I only took half a tablet to be able to function during the day.It is also a depressant which did not help me and is so ADDICTIVE that you actually fret about getting your next prescription. Xanax is used to treat a number of illnesses such as Bipolar, Panic disorder and insomnia.It is effective but also has some serious side effects and in the end you have to outweigh the good against the bad.

I didn't realize it was the medication that caused the edena until I quit taking it. When I started back on the medication I immediately swelled with edema.

Initially, it was working well, then I developed weight gain and terrible edema in my ankles and legs. Sometimes it didn't make me sleepy and I doubled my dose. It literally made me green with nausea, but I was able to sleep. Lighter doses didn't work. My doctor gradually upped my dose until it was high enough to be effective. After 5 years, I decided to quit taking the medicine cold turkey. This was five months ago because of the low libido. I was a basket case, but it was out of my system in about four days. I later found out that you should go off it gradually with a doctor's supervision. Quitting, as I did, could cause you to be suicidal. It certainly was very difficult on me. 

During my time drug free, I developed anger issues, depression and wanted to hurt myself. My sleep became light again, causing muscle pain from lack of rest.

After several months drug free, I restarted the medication for insomnia. Immediately my ankles and legs swelled greatly with edema. The water retention and edema is still there even after several days of discontinuing the medication. Maybe this is because I took a high dosage. I plan to go back to my doctor and try something different.",high

THE LORAZEPAM WAS STOPPED AFTER A WEEK WHEN I COMPLAINED OF INEFFECTIVENESS. I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS WITH THIS MEDICATION. I WAS TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION ONCE A DAY IN THE MORNING.  WHEN I FELT NO BENEFIT I DISCUSSED IT WITH THE DOCTOR WHO SUGGESTED AN INCREASE OF THE DOSAGE.  I DECLINED.

The patches were prescribed following a consulatation with the local pain clinic and unsuccessful nerve blocks performed by both the pain clinic and the fracture consultant.

Prior to taking this drug I had never had problems with ""seasickness"" while sailing. I found I had to stay topside during sailing times.  Other than that, the tiredness was a factor which became less noticeable with time.  The seasickness would not be a problem for the majority of people, I am sure Treatment was 1 pill per day for approximately 3 years (25 mg) which I am told is a quite low dose for this medication.

If I breath very deep less than a minute it goes away. Since they destroyed my lungs in that biopsy; I don't know if it is nerves or oxygen causing that.

nasonex,10,"nasonex allergies - My son suffered from headaches that would really affect his daily activities. He was prescribed the Nasonex to control his allergies and reduce his sinus symptoms that may have been contributing to his headaches. After about 2 weeks of daily use of the nasonex, his headaches were occurring siginificantly less often and he felt much relief. He was able to reduce his use of ibuprofen which I was really glad for because I worried that he may have rebound headaches from over-use of ibuprofen. I also worried that he may develop an ulcer from using the NSAID's so frequently. He was also able to get a better nights sleep. That improved his performance at school and his general energy level. Previously he was always tired during the day, after he started taking the nasonex continuously, as directed, he felt more energetic, and had many less headaches, too. At first, the nasal spray was a little irritating to the nose, and he would sneeze after the administration. He just didn't like the spray into his nose. He stuck with it and after about 5 days, it didn't bother him anymore. other than that, we have not noticed any negative side effects of the medication.

If I wouldn't have stopped I would be skin and bones. I got to a point where I lost color and I'm now way too skinny. Another side effect that I developed is insomnia. I have a VERY hard time sleeping. I can't fall asleep until about 1:00 and that's every night. It's horrible. Another side effect that's very serious, is development of depression. I had to go on anti-depressants because of the drug about 3 months after using adderall. It depresses you so much. After school I'd get home and be so depressed. I'd cry and just feel so misserable. I was seriously depressed. A fact that everyone should understand about adderall is that it's in a way a wattered down version of meth. The side effects are the same but not as severe. But it's still bad. It will mess up your teeth by giving you a VERY dry mouth, your weight and most of all your brain chemistry. I went from ADD to depression to now ADHD. I'm going back on stimulant drugs like adderall when school starts. I don't know how it'll work out because I now have a tolerance to it. And I'm getting new treatment. I don't know what'll happen or anything. But I just wantto get through school. Anyone that will be perscribbed to this should research on it and get the facts. Research for a long time. Not just one article reading. Get as much info as possible. The side effects are so severe that you should really know what you're exposing yourself to. They're all horrible. Especially the addiction that you get to it. I'm addicted to it and can't stop craving it. I feel like I need it so bad. It's been months and still I want it extremely bad. Be careful what choice you make. It gets the job done. Hut will screw up your life. This is just my experience. It may be different for you but still do your research.

However after taking it for only two weeks I had a seizure that sent me to hospital and was told by doc there that elavil and tramadol combined can cause seizures! NO ONE told me this. Not my primary care doc, my GI doc or the pharmacist. This seems to me to be a pretty severe ""side effect"" for a medicine that barely works! The two meds were prescribed to me by the same physician and I understand oversights can happen. However if I had known from beginning that seizures might be a possibility I would asked for something else. Also after only two weeks I had some weird effects after stopping usage including diarrhea, cold sweats, hot flashes, restless leg syndrome and anxiety. I never experienced anything like this with any other meds. This medicine is NOT worth it! 1 to 2 50mg tablets every 4 to 6 hours.",Low

Feeling of raised body temperature and heat. Mood changes (feeling positive) Generally 20mg for 3 days then dropping 5mg per day every 3 days. Once at 5mg the dose is halved every three days. It should never be stopped suddenly.,high
effexor,7,"effexor depression - Long-term mild to good relief from the worst aspects of depression.  Provided a ""floor"" to my mood and I never go below that.  Prior to Effexor (and before that, Prozac) I had frequent periods of suicidality.  I still often get very depressed but am much more functional and my behavior has stabilized. The inability to drink more than 2 glasses of wine at a time! Effexor was first prescribed by psychiatrist and then by psychopharmacologist.  I see the psychopharmacologist every 3 months for 1/2 hour to evaluate the efficacy of meds.",high
chantix,10,"chantix smoking cessation - Long-time smokers finally have something to help them stop smoking and not have the headaches and the withdrawals! The only side effect that I had was strange dreams for the first few nights. Every day you are to take Chantix once in the morning and once at night, and set a date to stop smoking. That is what I did, and I set my date at ten days after I starting taking the medication. In less time than ten days, I was not reaching for a cigarette with my morning coffee. I stopped smoking all together in two weeks, but took the medication for four months. When family and friends that are smokers would come over, I would want to smoke with them. I restarted the program twice, then told myself I would just have to NOT smoke with them.",high
claritin,7,"claritin spring allergies, allergy cough - I only took it one time, and experienced a side effect (dry mouth). Did not really kick in, but I guess this med. is not supposed to work immediately I had a dry mouth and my eyes were dry. Basically I had allergies and severe allergy seasonal cough. Doctor told me to try Claritin. I only took it once just to see if the drug would work. The drug did not work right away. As it is stated in the label, this drug takes time (perhaps about a week) in order to be effective. I ended up not taking anything. As soon as mid June came around, the allergies and cough that lasted about 3 months all went away.",high
renova,9,"renova acne & sun damaged skin - The skin texture appears improved after only 4 weeks of use. I have much acne less breakouts and day by day I see a steady improvement. My skin is much smoother than before and starts having a beautiful glow (which it hasn't had in years!) I did have slight skin irritation during the first 2 weeks of use and after the second week I started having a few acne cysts (which is apparently a normal skin reaction during the first weeks of treatment). Nevertheless, I asked my doctor to put me on minocycline in order to avoid additional acne scars. This combination (Retin-A-Micro & Mincycline) works wonders! I apply a thin layer of retin-a-micro gel every night after cleansing on my face and onto the acne prone areas on the chest. In order to avoid skin irritation, I used as little gel as possible during the first weeks. I think this is why I had only minor side effects. My skin has started to be used to the medication and I therefore can now use a bit more (though still a thin layer).",high
differin,6,differin acne - Exfoliates the skin. It is said to prevent or treat acne and acne scars. whether this is true is questionable. the drug induced some dryness and flakiness especially around the nose area and chin area. this side effect can go away after a while the product is a gel that is put on every night. it supposedly prevents new  blemishes and promotes exfoliation. the results for the blemishes were not satisfactory.,high
prilosec,10,"prilosec acid reflux - This medication provided me with total relief from heartburn. It is normally taken  daily, 1/2 hour before breakfast. There were no sside effects. This generic version of Prilosec OTC can be taken daily  on a long term basis to prevent/control the symptoms of acid reflux. It is very easy to remember to take it, as it is normally taken at the same time every day-- before breakfast.",high
vicodin,10,"vicodin diverticulitis / kidney infection - reduced the intensity of the pain and allowed for rest to recuperate I had no queasiness or nausea, no jittery feelings. No hives. I had severe diverticulitis with a kidney infection. I was hospitalized for a week and taking antibiotics and pain medication for two weeks after my release. Of course in the hospital morphine was administered for the pain management, but hydrocodone/acetaminophen was prescribed upon my release. I took the 10/500 which was more cost effective because I was able to break them in half to be less damaging to the kidneys and liver.
I have taken other pain medication which gave me hives, made me have nausea or become jittery.  I had no side effects from taking this medication or addictive desires to continue it after the infection was cleared up.",high

lithium-carbonate,7,"lithium-carbonate bipolar - I have found that I have been able to sleep better and my thoughts do not race like they did when I was not taking the lithium.  It has not made me as tired or hungry as other meds have which was a welcome surprise.  Still not able to focus as well as I had hoped.  I work full-time and hold an aditional part-time job and was worried that I was not going to be able to continue with these prior to beginning with this treatment.  I have been managing better since taking the lithium. Blurry vision to the point where I now have to wear glasses.  My skin has acne and I didn't have it before.  I have to use a prescription to controle it.  My acid reflux is terrible and i have to use a prevacid to control that.  My skin is very dry and it has become so bad that if i don't moisturize it will bleed.  Mild tremmor.  Slight confusion and inability to concentrate sometimes.  My hair falls out more than it used to.  As my doctor says: it's a dirty drug.  However, I'm not a zombie and I can sleep so I can learn to live with the above. I started at 150mg and slowly went up by 150mg every time the side effects calmed down.  Usually when I stopped tasting the metallic taste in my mouth I would increase the dose.  I've been on toprimate 400mg for one year.  Therapy with my psychiatrist twice per week (sometimes once per week due to scheduling conflicts).",high
tirosint,6,"tirosint hypothyroidism - It seemed to stabilize my metabolism. I didn't seem to see any and was frequently not sure if I was actually getting the right dose.  It took about 3 years to get the current dose right.  And since that time I haven't changed it.  I have found out that the dosage I am taking is the very least amount I can take and still take thyroid medicine. I take one thyroid pill a day.  I did originally take Synthyroid, but changed to the generic brand about 5 years ago to save on total costs.  Since I have been on generic brands, the shape of the pill has changed.  Also, so has the directions on taking it.  Now I can hardly take it and have it be effective, because I have to take the pill on an empty stomach, with a full glass of water, in the morning, and I can't have anything that might interfere with its absorption for 4 hours -- such as food, vitamins, or any other medicine.  So I do not know if it is effective or not, since I would have to try and take it in the middle of the night.  I am not going to do that, so I take it at night before going to sleep --- without a full glass of water.",high
panixine-disperdose,8,"panixine-disperdose acne - I had severe acne for many years and I was sort of living with it without seeking cures seriously. I tried a couple of other anti-biotics before but not very diligently. I started to be more disciplined and actually took Keflex every day. In the beginning I was also taking Apri the birth control pill. I took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. Then I stop Apri, and I continued with Keflex. And it seems that if I stop Keflex, my acne will come back a little. So I have not tried stoping Keflex for more than a week or two. I am a little concerned with the long term side effects of Keflex although I am not sure whether there should be any. I think I will continue taking Keflex and I will also ask my docotor to test blood or any other things that I should be cautious of. It is hard to say. I have chronic headaches and general stress. So I am not sure whether the Keflex may have made matters a bit worse sometimes. Overall, I can't seem to correlate Keflex to my other conditions at all. ...",high
malarone,3,"malarone malaria prevention - The benefits if I had continued to take the Malarone for the entire two weeks would have been to not contract Malaria.  But the side effects were severe enough that I discontinued treatment and followed other preventative measures. I had an overall sense of unwellness.  Nausea was constant even when the drug was taken separate from other drugs and with food/on a full stomach etc.  I felt almost flu like; ie the beginning of flu onset when you are not yet fully sick. When I discontinued use (while still in a Malaria risk area) I relied soley on preventative measures.  I was in a night biting mosquito area (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia) so slept under a mosquito net.  Used mosquito spray in the room and used a special spray for one set of clothing for higher risk environments (ie jungle).  Also spoke with an Asian doctor at length about the Western philosphy vs Eastern for treatment.  His take was that Eastern doctors choose to treat malaria when it is contracted but Western take higher and higher levels of drugs to prevent contraction.  This may lead to drug resistant strains...",Low

I was diagnosed two years ago with Multiple Sclerosis and have a spastic bladder.  Soon after being prescribed Detrol LA, I had a definite decrease in urination frequency.  However, after about six months, my urinary habits returned to pre-medication levels.  I void every two hours.  About one year ago, I stopped taking Detrol LA for two months, thinking that giving my bladder a break from the med would help.  I then restarted Detrol LA and noticed no difference.  I am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.  It is essentially useless. Mild dry mouth.  Otherwise, no side effects. I have been on Detrol LA for since being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years ago.  I have a spastic bladder and urinate every two hours.  I take 2mg twice a day.  The medicine worked for about six months, then was virtually ineffective.",Low

Also, resolution of sore throat and hoarse voice that I had waked up with for many years. none that I notice, however, there is a study out that indicates that people over 50 who take proton pump inhibitors are more likely to develop osteoporosis.  I was diagnosed with osteopenia in my late forties, even though I take calcium and exercise.

I couldn't find anything to help me with the pain and found this medical condition debilitating. Insurance won't pay for specialists and/or treatments for this condition. My PCP gave me a prescription for this medication and it so far has really really helped the pain. I take it twice a day with a meal (Very important) and the pain level has decreased so much! I know everyone's condition effects them differently but after trying over the counter medications as well as Pain medication prescribed by my PCP this has been the most helpful so far. Thank you Meloxicam! I have experienced no side effects. I feel a little different at times - more relaxed than anything since it helps with my pain.

I had an echo and stress test which were all normal. each day after taking the pill, i find relief in the chest pain for a while, but then after about an hour it will sometimes come back. I have noticed increase in headaches since taking this med which i went to see a neurologist who wanted me to take neurontin but I refuse to take. He stated the headaches have nothing to do with the heart, but i disagree because when i have this chest pain, the headaches usually are there to, and when the chest pain isn't there, the headache isn't there. increase in headache. started out the first week with breaking 5mg in half. then after that been taking 5mg daily.

There was some mild flushing feelings,  without flushed skin.  If the medicine was not taken with food there was an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach about three hours after ingestion. Niaspan was prescribed after emergency double by-pass.  My cholesterol began rising at around age 50.  I thought estrogen treatment for menopause would additionally lower cholesterol however it did not.  Significant dietary restrictions,  already in place for many years,  did not lower cholesterol.

I felt like I have had more control over my emotions, being that I could be upset and crying one minute and then just fine the next. I had headaches for several weeks after taking this med.  Along with insomnia.  I also had some mild weight gain.  After being on it for several months I lost my urge to be sexual active.

Hair loss. Hyperthyroid at first then Hypothyroid. The initial weight loss is pretty cool but over time can lead to malnourishment.  Have to be careful not to fall into a ""manic"" mode because it is totally annoying to others.  Also it tends to cause tension in my back.  I've spent much money at the chiropractor over the years.  Otherwise the pain is unbearable. This medicine changed my life, but there are still spin off's of ADD, like the auditory processing, anxiety and emotional control and general sensitivity that have to be dealt with.  Not to mention health issues like making sure to get enough vitamins (kelp levels out my thyroid pretty well), and picking up a prescription from the doctor every 30 days.

I actually had to hold a vomit bag while I sat on the couch, and car rides were pretty impossible from motion sickness. But that passed pretty quickly. I began on 50mg, after growing absolutely sick of feeling terrible all the time. I went on this for about six months, with little difference in my moods.

I still have a long way to go and I believe that I will need to take these two drugs for a while as I tried quitting the prozac and immediately resumed the depression. A little more sleepy and lack energy.  Also, it's obvious with the prozac that I'm at a point that I'm not able to go off of it without replacing it with something.  The vicodin doesn't seem to be a problem with side effects as long as I don't take more than one tablet at a time (500/5). I've had depression and pain for some time.  They have both caused serious problems in my life.  I found myself isolated and sleeping far too much.  I did some research and found that lack of seritonin could cause an increse sensitivity to pain so I was hoping that my pain would subside with this treatment.  So far, I can't tell the difference.

There have been some deposits of fatty nodules just below the skin in several locations.  There has not been a causative link between the Niaspan pointed out to me. However since the Niaspan  reduces the circulating amount of a fatty chemical, the appearance of fatty deposits is suspicious. Two pills, 1000mg per pill, taken in the evening, with an 81mg enteric aspirin.

None really.  however, I am concerned about the correlation to osteoporosis, since proton pumps are probably involved in bone remodeling.  Now I take only 20mg daily as needed. Take 20mg first thing in the morning about half an hour before breakfast, or before I have a meal I know will cause problems - Italian food, garlic, spicy, etc.",high

Came on this website to see if others had the same problem.  Haven't taken Zyban since and don't intend to.  Scares the crap out of me. Call if coincidence if you will but I don't.

Then my stomach was hurting and I had diarrhea. I decreased the dosage (on my own, which I would not advise others to do) because I have a history of pseudo-membranous colitis, and I need to be cautious of antibiotics. However, I needed the med for the kidney infection. On days 2-5 I took 250mg 3 times a day (eight hrs apart). This reduction in dosage relieved the stomach pain and the diarrhea.

If you looked at me in the daylight, you would say that I had a ""balding problem"" and of course with the transplants I looked strange  After 6 months, it totally covered my crown and increased the texture of the remaining hair to a coarser density.  All of the fine hairs which were dormant came back with stronger and previous-strength follicles.  The transplanted hair on the top also became coarser.  Except in a very strong light looking directly down on the top of my head, now no one would say I was bald or even ""thinning.""

Also noticed an increased productivity at work and better interpersonal interactions.  Additionally, the XR formulation is easier to take properly because it only has to be taken once a day, versus 3 - 4 times a day for the non extended release formula. The main side effects experienced included loss of appetite and increased anxiety, especially towards the end of the drug's effectiveness period (about 8 hours).  This is an improvement over short-acting Focalin where these side effect was experienced up to 3xs a day.  I did not experience any other side effects. Diagnosed with ADHD at 17.  On some form of Ritalin since 17.  Ritalin had too many side effects so used Focalin.

Though starting at 37.5 mg, the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition. As the dosage increased, the lack of effect turned into a complete removal of affect as well as a persistent feeling of listlessness and heaviness (like having weights on limbs and chest). Though starting at 37.5 mg, the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition. The month was ended abruptly due to hospitalization for attempted suicide by overdose. I was not weened off of the medication. The doctor was then brought before a committee for misconduct in prescribing Effexor to a minor as well as disregarding warning signs of a suicidal youth.

I look forward to a 2 year review! I've noticed an increase in sexual desire over this period.

I had two one week stays in the hospital with cellulitis and staff. The enbrel lowered my resistance to infection and I was advised to stop the injections.

advair-hfa,9,"advair-hfa asthma/allergies - Overall, the benefits have been very good.  A rescue inhaler hasn't been used in more than a year, nor has there been a severe asthma attack.  During the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold, damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  There are times of wheezy, heavy-chestedness, but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking Advair. Wallet shock.  Patient seems to overall fall asleep easier, but tends to have some problems getting a deep sleep, but this may or may not be related to the Advair.  Other than that, there do not seem to be any adverse side effects  -- casually or medically -- after about 1-1/2 years of taking the medication. The patient developed asthma four years ago.  It was controlled on an 'attack' basis, generally with an OTC inhaler.  When most OTC inhalers were taken off the market prior to reformulation, and a severe asthma attack, a prescription inhaler was prescribed, but it was being used more often than should, and did not alleviate the problems.  After a thorough examination, the doctor prescribed Advair, as directed with two puffs/inhales daily, morning and evening (at least 8 hours apart).

ativan,8,"ativan insomnia - I have had problems falling asleep for many years. I had tried various other medicines, both over the counter and prescription, and nothing seemed to work - some didn't work at all, some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night, and others made me tired and feeling as if I were drugged the next morning. Then one day, my dentist prescribed one Ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction, and I actually fell asleep standing up! This is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep, sleep through the night, and doesn't make me feel tired the next day. Plus, it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry, anxiety, and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before. One of the warnings on the bottle is ""May cause drowsiness"". Well, that's why I am taking it! If you don't want to feel drowsy, then Ativan is probably not for you. Another drawback is that if it is used too often, your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. When I first began taking Ativan, I only needed half a mg. to fall asleep, so I would cut a tablet in half. I only use it 3 or 4 times a month, but even at that dosage, after having used it for several years, I now find I have to take a whole tablet in order for the Ativan to help me sleep. After having this prescribed to me by my dentist, I knew it was very effective. I'd tried various other medications prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep, so I told him I'd like to try Ativans as they had worked so well as a relaxant before a dental extraction. We worked together to come up with a dosage, and he then prescribed the 1mg. As stated before, the one mg. was more than enough at first, so I would cut the tablets in half and for the first couple years this worked just fine. For the past couple years though, I've had to use the 1mg. before bedtime... and will probably have to talk with my doctor soon about going to a stronger dosage as I am noticing lately that it is not working as well as it once did.",high

topamax,10,"topamax migraine - Greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily.  This drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so dibilitating that I could not function in everyday life, i.e., go to work, take care of self and family, etc.  Migraines were reduced after approximately 6-8 weeks on the medication to about 1 per month and then continually reduced to 1 every 3 to 6 months as I stayed on the medication.  I also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood stabalizer, because this drug also manages to keep me from getting ""manic"", so it is an extra ""bonus"" on top of the migraine management!! The only side effect I noticed was some weight loss in the beginning.  My doctor was very careful to start me out on 50 MG and move me up VERY slowly to the 200 MG 2x per day, which I understand is a very high dosage and took all of 4 years to get to that dosage.  I was monitored every 30 days to ensure that I was not losing too much weight, having any type of eye problems, or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems, and numbness I never experienced; but was always told that if I did experience even a hint of these things, that I would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  I have also read that Topamax has been used to treat alcoholics, and have noticed that since taking it, I have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but I am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  It really just seems like a great drug!! I am still taking it to manage both  my migraines and my mood disorder--200 MG 2x per day.  I take 2 in the AM and 2 in the PM.  It is prescribed by my Neurologist and managed by him mostly; and my psychatrist also works with him, because if I ever go off of the drug, I would be required to go onto a mood stabalizer due to the bi-polar disorder.  I would be very unhappy to have to go back onto something like Depakote, because that made me very slow and sluggish and Topamax does not have that side effect.",high

I suspected that I was not in the control group because of my dramatic results.  Following the study, we were each given a consultation with the physician who was overseeing the test.  He was the head of the Psychopharmacology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  He explained to me how the drug worked and suggested that I stay on it for a while.

This product is effective at reducing the production of mucus and eye irritation from a sever allergy to dust. I haven;t used this Generally, I find allergy medications, such as Claritin and Zyrtec to be too drying to be useful. I live in a dry city (Los Angeles) and I am prone to nose bleeds, dry eyes and dry skin. There is still some drying associated with this drug if I take it daily. However, if I take it occasionally, it is fine. I also can tolerate prolonged usage of this medication better than  I can other allergy medications. The prescription says to take 1 tablet every day as needed for allergies. My allergist suggested I use this daily, as I have chronically dark circles under my eyes and a drippy nose, even though I have a home with zero carpet and have sealed my bed and pillows in allergen barriers. However, I do not take this daily because it is drying and costly to do so. I use this occasionally when I sleep at someone';s house or need to dust or sweep.",high

I occasionally notice some discharge. I also feel bloated for a day or so after inserting. The small tablet is inserted vaginally twice a week. It's recommended that you do so at the same time of day. Twice a week is somewhat difficult to keep track of. Does that mean every 3 days or every 4 days? It involves marking treatment down on a calendar to maintain a regular schedule.",high
synthroid,10,"synthroid thyroid cancer - The treatment benefits of taking Synthroid have everything to do with metabolism regulation.  Because I had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  Since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed, it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own. There have been no treatment side effects for me thus far. Treatment consists simply of taking a 100 mcg Synthroid pill each morning.  This should be taken on an empty stomach and no food should be taken for one full hour.  It is also important not to take any calcium supplement for four hours after taking Synthroid.  Calcium interferes with the body's ability to effectively utilize the Synthroid.",high

Helping you to relax and feel better.",high
tetracycline,1,tetracycline ulcer - cant say because I had to stop taking it after just 2 days due to severe after effects excrutiaing stomach/intestinal pain The drug was prescribed for treating H-pylori infection but it caused ore severe pain than hte ailment itself. It was too strong a drug for me and I had to be switced erothromycin and amoxcillin after only 2 days of tetracycline combo. It also made me dizzy.,Low
prinivil,1,"prinivil high-normal hypertension - Lowered blood pressure Extreme lethargy, coughing all day and during the night. Dry mouth and gagging at night. Nausea and the feeling of a weight on my chest. Sneezing, sore throat.  Because I have allergies, I thought they were just giving me more trouble than usual. Constipation/diarrhea. The feeling of being winded with only a moderate amount of activity. I am only 15 lbs. overweight and am used to a very active life but feel down and depressed a lot and have problems getting to sleep at night. I had an average of 135 to 145 over 80 or 90 that is called high-normal.  But because I had a stroke in my eye, my doctor felt that I had had a spike in blood pressure that caused the problem. I was given Coreg which brought the numbers down a bit, but then my Dr. felt that lisinopril would help take it down lower along with the Coreg-which it did. But then, my allergies seem to get really horrible and my breathing got worse and worse until I mentioned all of my symptoms at my three month check up today. It wasn't my allergies, it was the medication. We stopped the lisinoprol.  I have never had such bad affects from a medication. I hope the new medication will be better, but you can bet I will check it out thoroughly before taking it.",Low
elavil,4,"elavil insomnia - The drug helped with sleep, but was inconsistent. I was a chronic insomniac, rarely sleeping more than 5 hours a night, often less.  With amitriptyline I was able to sleep more regularly (although not always), thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole. Unfortunately, athough I was sleeping more regularly, I was still not rejuvenated.  The sleep was of a drugged quality, remarkably different from a natural sleep, in that I still felt tired a lot of the time.  Always dry mouth after the night, and after several years of use, I wondered if it had affected my memory, as loss of memory was notable. Seems to me that I had frequent headaches, as well. I took the drug every night, just before I intended to sleep.  Often I would fall asleep, but still wake in the night, although usually falling asleep again, which I would not be able to do without the drug.  Mornings were a little foggy for me, and there was the reality of dry-mouth, and the possibility of a headache.  I tried to quit for several months after the second year, but was so plagued by insomnia that I went back on it.  After another 9 months or so, I quit because I was worried that the long term use had affected my memory and the efficacy of the drug was inconsistent in any case.",Low

Acne I was prescribed generic Flonase about 6 months ago for nasal congestion due to allergies. I've always had some sporadic adult acne flair ups from time to time, but it got much worse after I started using this nasal spray. I even started getting some pimples on my chest which I never had before.  I didn't know the Flonase was the cause until recently when I was looking up information on acne treatments online. I came across something that said steroids could cause acne, so I looked up the side effects of Flonase and sure enough acne was listed.  I stopped using Flonase a week and a half ago and the acne is completely gone!",high
patanol,8,"patanol eye allergies - I have seasonal allergies and especially in the spring and fall, my eyes itch and get dry. These drops contain anti-histamines that are delivered directly into the eye, and therefore are more effective than just using anti-histamine pills. I think they also helped with the eczema-like flaking on my eyelids but I cannot be sure because I was also using anti-histamine pills at the time. I did not experience any side effects. These drops really helped with the symptoms but I did wish I could use it more often than just 2 times a day.",high

Started with 0.025 mg 2 X per week.  Then started having more hot flashes so am trying 0.0375 mg.  If cost is an issue, you CAN cut these patches.

I rated a 7 due to the potential it has after one experience. Blue/green clouds are nothing to scoff at! Hallucinations, waking up feeling as if in out to sea on a small sailboat and i am trying to walk below deck and its very rough waves outside. I was swaying pretty hard, then came the blue and green clouds, which i had to walk through, WHICH did not go away for hours, until i called in sick and took a nap.

Lexapro 10mg in the morning.
7.5mg Remeron 1 hour before bed.
Lexapro is WAY too stimulating. I cant imagine it making me groggy really, it feels almost like cathinone stimulation. On the verge of euphoric, but not, and very jittery - so i was hoping the remeron would counteract that like the doc said. Another day on the weekend this time(blue and green keyboard made it really hard to work in the morning) ill attempt to start again, hopefully that was a strange occurrence(although, it was entertaining, but not ok for going to work!).",high

So, walking becomes very difficult.  As long as I'm taking the medication, but regions do not cause me the severe pain I'm in without it. Unfortunately, I wasn't always taking it with food, so not sure if that was the cause or I just developed side effects from the medication.  But, after being on it for a year and a half I developed severe stomach pains, and gas.  My stomach would swell as the day went on and became very hard and painful.  So I stopped taking the drug and those things went away, but my foot got so bad I couldn't walk, so now I'm trying it every other day, but still my stomach tends to become a bit upset.

diazepam,1,"diazepam anxiety - None Drug-induced psychosis, resulting in 10 day commitment to a mental institution. Many people I know - I now work as a health care professional - erroneously believe that Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and other benzodiazepines must be used ""as directed"" and have enhanced benefit if ""built up in the brain""- ie: in ways similar to SSRI's effect on the brain over time.  I was entirely aware that diazepam is a ""prn"" medication, and chose to use the prescribed dosage on one particular day hoping it would carry me through a difficult situation. Unfortunately, I suffered a ""paradoxical reaction"" which cost me dearly in many tragic ways.  I was in a state of severe psychosis for days- because my ""benzo"" level was low when admitted to the hospital, I was given diazepam for an additional two days, whereupon I apparently refused to take any medication at all, and recovered as I ""detoxed"".  I have absolutely no memory of five days of my life.  I have done research into this phenomenon, and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/GABA reuptake variants- such as those with ADHD, Parkinsons, and also PTSD.  Diazepam is a ""bandaid"" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  In fact, ""rebound"" anxiety and profound depression are common. What is most ironic is that in the medical setting, this occurs often after administration of ""Versed"", is recognized quickly, and fluzanimine is given as an antidote. Outside of this scenario, the patient is blamed, treated as a suspected drug addict, and stigmatized.",Low

The Celexa was effective in elevating my mood which had been diagnosed as depression.  It was the doctor�s belief that the long term effects of the parasite presence in my body led to my decline in physical and mental health.  I continued on the generic form of Celexa, Citalopram for a total of three years.  I no longer take medication for depression and my health is quite good. The side effect of the Vermox was primarily a metallic taste in my mouth which lasted throughout the treatment of twenty one days.

amoxil,10,"amoxil chest infection - Prior to taking the Amoxicillin I was in a lot of discomfort including tightness in the chest, fever, painful cough and difficulty in breathing. This meant that I was not able to work and had to stay in bed. The effects of the Amoxicillin was almost immediate in that within two hours of taking the drug many of they symptoms had diminished considerably; in particular, breathing was no longer difficult or painful and the fever was reduced. Due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of Amoxicillin I was able to return to work almost immediately. There were no noticable side effects.  For the seven day period that I was taking the Amoxicillin caplets I did not feel 'normal' in that I felt light headed and somewhat disconnected.  However, I was still coughing with the chest infection and it was difficult to tell how much of what I was feeling was due to the infection and its after-effects and how much was due to the Amoxicillin.  My own perception was that the Amoxicillin had no noticable side-effects. I was prescribed 21 Amoxicillin caplets which were 500mg per dose.  I was instructed to take the medicine at regularly spaced intervals and to complete the prescribed course.  I therefore took one caplet at breakfast at around 8am, one caplet after lunch at around 3pm and one caplet in the evening at around 10pm.

Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived, I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking, but without any of the fun. The next day, upon advice from my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg, with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill), and still felt nauseous, hot, dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!!

I really did not experience any side effects. I did notice however that when I took it on an empty stomach, I would get a little bit nausiated. I took it for two weeks straight and never experienced any bad side effects other than feeling a little sick to my stomach if I did not eat anything before I took it. I was prescribed diclofenac for a badly herniated disc in my lower back.  When I went in to the doctors office I could barely walk.

There were however, other side effects listed on the prescription contraindication form.  I do not recall what the side effects listed on that form were now. he Doctor told me to take  he medication at bed time each evening. she also suggested that I might find it useful to sleep with a contour pillow between my thighs.

Some stimulation occurred - 7-10 follicles were stimulated with each treatment - but conception did not occur. Visual disturbances (flashing light effects, blurring), mood swings, fluid retention. Clomid was given on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle, one 50 mg pill by mouth per day, at the same time each day.  Follicle progress was subsequently tracked via ultrasound.

I have had a very difficult time getting traditional Dr.s to look beyond the Thyroid and to realize that for a woman it becomes a package deal. Once you hit menopause and the chemical balance shifts it is not enough to look at one part of the body and blame that for all your symptoms. I was NEVER sick as a child or young adult. I never had female problems, but once menopause set in my body went haywire. I KNOW, in speaking with women my own age,that I am not an isolated case. Thyroid disease is more prevalent than ever and this drug does not cut it for some patients. One pill every morning 1 hour before breakfast. Just recently instructions have included not taking vitamins with Calcium 2 hrs after the pill, but this has not made a difference.",high

Sleeping very well. Feel like a normal human being again! Groggy early in the morning but an espresso and a bit of exercise wakes me up completely. (Wish someone had told me to exercise early in the morning before!) Also learnt to take pills earlier at night (6pm) for better sleep and less grogginess in the morning. Initially picked up 30 lbs but now losing weight through exercise and watching intake. Seroquel makes me hungry but I choose what to put in my mouth. When I am manic or depressed, I eat anything, but on Seroquel I can at least choose what and when to eat. I have suffered from migraines (with aura) for decades, but these have stopped too! The longer I have been on Seroquel, the less the side effects became. Started on 25 mg and stopped after a few months. Restarted at 150 mg, then 200 mg and now 300 mg.",high

The name brand product does not work any better than the generic.
It only works about 1/2 as well the original Estrace.  From my research on the web, I am not the only person with this problem.   I really miss my old Estrace!  I am sending this product and the generic product to an independent lab and have the ingredients analyzed.  The generic and the name brand are manufactured by the same company.  My money is on them being identical products!!! I sincerely believe this company is selling their generic form of Estrace as their name brand.  The are cashing in all over the market.",high

Finally, I quit cold turkey, suffered the withdrawal for about two days. Took over 8 months until the nerve jumps in my skin stopped at night. I wanted a non-addictive drug since I am a recovering alcoholic so my doctor thought this was the ticket. The withdrawal was not worth the pain it initially alleviated.

It has been the only treatment that works for my leg pain. I have taken it nightly for 2 years now. It has no side effects for me at all. I have not shown any signs of being addicted to the drug.

Her marks were terrible, she was failing many classes in spite of studying for hours on end (I can verify this as I studied with her) Her self esteem was very low due to this and the fact that she has a sister who consistently achieves high grades.

After seeing a neurologist and doing many test she was diagnosed with ADD.  We started her on Adderall and the results have been amazing.  Now, she does minimal studying and her marks are EXCELLENT!  She is able to focus and really pay attention in classes so the information is not only understood but retained.  Her self esteem has soared and she is once again a happy little girl. We took her off the time released medication and switched is a regular so that it would not interfer with her sleep which it did in the beginning with the time released.

Seroquel allowed the patient to obtain deep (REM) sleep allowing for a rejuvinated physical state that, in turn, lifted the mood and outlook of the patient. Headache and drowsiness during the day were the number one and two side effects. The drowsiness was kept in check by adjusting the doseage downward. Started with 25 mg, moved up to 50 mg and then to 100 mg per day. Found it best to move back to 50 mg to avoid side effects.

Without it, I walk with a cane- with it, I don't need a cane, and can even walk for a mile or so for exercize, without 'paying for it' the next day. At first it made me pretty drowsy.  After about three weeks, my body adjusted to it, and the drowsiness went away.  I have to be sure to take Etodolac after eating a meal, or it causes rather pronounced nausea.  I've found that it has to be an actual meal, too.  Just a nibble of something isn't enough to prevent the upset stomach. I am severely allergic to Aspirin and Naproxyn, so cannot take these for the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis.  I developed OA in both knees after injuring the cartilage and the arthroscopic surgery to try to repair the damage.  My left knee still has a little cartilage, but the right knee has bone on bone.

I did not feel the need to increase dosage beyond that, as I stopped smoking, and was having side effects of nausea, stomach cramps, kidney pain, as well as mood changes, which I had anticipated, and thought were normal.",Low

accutane,10,"accutane acne - Acne no more after 8 months of use.  I have yet to ever have another break out of acne, much less a more than one flare up of more than one pimple at a time, and that is once in a blue moon. Dryness of the skin and mouth, peeling/flaking.  Seemed like my acne was getting worse, but I was told, my skin was purging the acne out, and that is exactly what it did! I went once a month to see my dermatologist, which he would look at and then prescribe me another refill of 30 pills, one to be taken everyday.  I had no insurance, so at the time I was using Accutane, it was $90.00, for a 30 day supply.  

I had to go once a month for a blood test, to make sure all organs were working properly. I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. 

The only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)

After, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening. By the end of the 8 months, I was taken off Accutane, and have never had acne since.  

It was the best thing that has ever happened to my skin.  I fought acne from the age of 14 to the age of around 24.  12 years later, I am still acne free.",high
citalopram,6,"citalopram depression - I found that the drug helped with mild depression/dysthymia.

retin-a,10,"retin-a acne and wrinkles - It had a dramatic impact in terms of reducing how often I would break out. My skin was smoother and more clear.  And the fine lines around my eyes were reduced dramatically. I would get some peeling or redness if I applied too much.  If this occurred, I would stop using it for a day or two, and the problem would go away.  It was more of a concern in the winter months when my skin was more dry.  But having oily skin, it usually wasn't a big problem. I was told to use it at night.  If redness or peeling occurred, use it less frequently.",high
neurontin,7,"neurontin peripheral pain arms - Reduced pain and discomfort in both arms.  Calmer and less anxious personality. Pt enjoyed her life just a slight bit better and was able to participate in other various activities with her friends, family and to do art work that she loves at the day center where she attends two times a week. Some mild dizziness initially.  Pt. reported light-headedness when getting up from a chair for a minute or two.  Side effects seem to have resolved, though maybe scattered thinking is slightly more increased. Pt was initially prescribed neurontin 300mg; one pill in the morning and one pill in the afternoom then two pills at bedtime.  Patient then began to complain of increased pain in upper arms and shoulders after about two years total on the recently described dosages.  The doctor then increased the dose, starting with 300mg, two pills in the morning, then one pill of same at noon and the two pills, 300mg each at bedtime for four days.  After that it will be neurontin 300mg, two pills in the morning, then two pills at noon and two pills at bedtime.  This regeme just began yesterday, so results of such are not yet observable.",high

The side effects included:  extreme dizziness, nausea, and disorientation.  Also experienced cold sweats. Vicodin (Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen) was prescribed at one to two 500mg tablets every four to six hours.

cymbalta,5,"cymbalta fibromyalgia - It seemed to relax me, which reduced some of the muscle pain that I had been having.  It seemed to slightly reduce the nerve pain, but not enough to warrant taking it long-term.  Other than that, I did not notice benefits specific to my fibromyalgia symptoms.  It did seem to neutralize my feelings however.  I could not experience deep sadness.  So, I can see how it would help with people suffering from depression. I experienced drowsiness in the first 1-2 weeks which went away.  At night, I experienced dry mouth and dry eyes, usually beginning about 8pm through bedtime.  I am a bit more drowsy in the morning.  It takes a bit longer to wake up completely in the morning. I took 20 mg. 1x per day (in the morning) for the first week, gradually working up to 60mg. 1x per day.  After 2 months, I am tapering down again.  60mg made me too drowsy.",high
naproxen,1,"naproxen costochondritis/ inflammation of the chest wall - none Nausea, loss of appetite, a little chest pain and vomiting. They gave me a shot of this at the hospital and then perscribed me with it. Once I got home I noticed I had an upset stomach, I thought it was because they gave me the shot on an empty stomach, so I ate something small and tried to take a nap. When I woke up from my nap my upset stomach did not go away and I felt naushes. I tried to drink a Powerade and eat a few preztles, that did not help at all. So for dinner I ate some soup and the upset stomach, nausea and chest pain still continued. I went to bed and woke up with stomach pains and still nausea. I ended up vomiting but only a little. I haven't taken any of the prescribed pills, just the shot at the hospital, and I am still feeling nausea, an upset stomach and a little chest pain. This medicine is not good at all. I couldn't lift anything heavy cause of the inflammation in my chest or breathe in really cold air. The doctor told me instead of using Naproxen I can take a hot shower, use a heating pad or to take Ibuprofen to alevate the pain I was feeling when the inflammation would come back or get worse.",Low
strattera,3,"strattera add - Strattera seemed to give me some energy and focus for a few hours.  However, about 5-6 hours after taking the pill, I get sleepy and groggy.  I have never taken a stimulant (newly diagnosed ADD), but this sounds familiar to the ""crash"" I hear people talking about.  So far the sleepiness and fatigue are out-weighing the benefits of this drug for me. See above.  Sleepiness and groggy-ness about 6 hours after dose.  I also feel irritable during the ""sleepy"" time, probably due to the fatigue factor.  I have noticed that little things get me irritated more easily while on Stattera. I am nervous about taking a stimulant, but this Strattera doesn't seem to be doing the trick for my ADD.  I also have no use for a med that makes me feel sleepy during the day...that is worse than the original ADD!!

Also, I have not noticed any appetite reduction, but it has raised my blood pressure.  I hear stimulants do that too, so I'm growing tired of messing with Strattera when I am getting stimulant side-effects with none of the stimulant benefits.",Low
paxil,6,"paxil depression - The treatment Benefits included feeling less anxiety, stress and pressure in many social situations. I felt less irritable and more willing and open for change. I had been feeling very down on myself and �lost� in terms of my emotional well being and stability. I had been feeling a lot of pressure and like I didn�t fit in in many situations. I also felt that many things in life were hard- even small things like showering or brushing my teeth. Taking this medication helped me to overcome those feelings and be able to do everyday things without seeing them as such a challenge. It stabilized my mood as well so I wasn�t experiencing major irritability, intense frustration or anger. The Side effects I experienced from this drug were minimal. I did experience some headaches and a bit of a �spacey� feeling in the head when I first started taking it. Overall, I would say that the major issue I experienced which I am considering a side effect was a dulling of the emotions. While it helped me to curb my frustration and irritability, it also dulled my ability to feel great happiness or excitement about anything. My husband complained that I just stopped caring about everything. I also became completely disinterested in sex. I am unsure of what the treatment details mean. I took this drug for about a year under the supervision of my general practioner. I took a 10 mg dosage the entire time. This dose was never increased. The drug took about 4 weeks before I noticed the benefits. I stopped taking the drug when I, along with my GP felt that I was doing better and no longer needed it.",high
differin,6,"differin acne - reduced acne and refined skin texture. Helped to prevent new breakouts to a certain extent. Dry skin. After washing even with the mildest cleansers I noticed my skin would be very tight and uncomforable. Differin is a retinoid, supposedly the mildest of all retinoids. I was prescribed this for mild, yet persistent acne. While it did help clear up the acne it also caused me to continue to get more pimples in areas I didnt normally get them. So it was a slight paradox. 

I would have continued to use the medication of it wasnt for the dryness and tighness I used to get after water touched my skin. My skin never felt comfortable. I gave it a good 5 months but my skin never seemed to adjust.

So while it worked pretty good for the acne, it also caused to much skin dryness. So I moved onto a new treatment method.",high
ambien,9,"ambien insomnia - For the treatment of insomnia, this drug induced sleepiness immediately after ingestion which was a tempory and necessary goal of the drug. minimal side effects included mild grogginess upon waking. Although this medication was immediately effective in treating insomnia, it was also temporary. More dosage was required after a few weeks, and addiction was possible. Off the medication, insomnia returned and was more severe than prior to taking this drug.",high
biaxin,1,"biaxin ulcer - I had been having abdominal pain for quites some time which was diagnosed as h-pylorybacter.  I started taking the Biaxin as pary of Prevpac.  In about 3 days, I noticed that the pain was lessening and I was feeling less run down. I had been ill due to the condition being undiagnosed for about 5 months. The infection was clearing up After  taking the Biaxin for 9 days and feeling much improvement, I started noticing some itchy bumps on my legs.  Over the next 2 days, my whole body erupted into welts, especially in the axilla, the groin. I called my doctoe and stopped the Biaxin. I continued to have new hives each day for the next 5 days.  Gradually they went away. To eliminate the side effects of hives, I had to stop the Biaxin and all other medication.  I ties taking Sudaphed to control the itching, but this was not effective.  I ended up going to the emergency room because the welst were so itchy and painful and I had not slept in 2 days.  They were unable to give me any medication for the reaction beacuse of my gastrointestinal distress.  I had to jus wait it out.",Low
nexium,8,"nexium acid reflux / barrett's esophagus - Pain and heartburn from extreme acid reflux is well controlled, hypersensitivity to certain food is suppressed and Barrett's Esophagus has not progressed. None that I am aware of. I take Nexium once a day in the morning. If I have a flare up of acid reflux, I will take another at dinner time. The once a day regime generally controls my acid reflux quite well. On the rare occasions when I forget to take Nexium, reflux flares up immediately, so I have good evidence it is responsible for the symptom control.",high
nexium,8,"nexium acid reflux - Reduced the acid reflux and heartburn that was present in the late evening hours. Overall, Nexium relieved me of acid reflux and heartburn. I did not experience side effects, although some people do. I took a pill everyday (with water) about a hour before my dinner. I did not skip any days, but used everyday, so as to prevent heartburn rather than treat it.",high
provigil,8,"provigil multiple sclerosis - Provigil energizes me which improves my ability to function. Without it, the fatigue I experience due to MS overwhelms me and renders me pretty much useless. The only side effect is increased wakefulness at night when I'd like to go to  sleep. The neurologist who first diagnosed the MS prescribed Provigil in 2001. At first I took only 100 milligrams per day, but have gradually increased the dose in order to get the same effect I got initially. I've asked my doctors several times if the drug is addictive, and they say it is not supposed to be.",high

paxil,10,paxil mild depression - I could see a dramatic difference in my mood within 3 weeks!  I felt interested in all my hobbies again plus I was smiling and laughing more.  My doctor told me I could be the poster child for Paxil.  This drug made a remarkable improvement in my mild depressive state.  I recently (5 wks ago) underwent gastric bypass surgery.  The doctor that performed this surgery told me not to quit taking Paxil...it would be like losing my best friend.  I have had absolutely no depression after my surgery (which I understand is not common).  This drug is amazing! The only side effects I had were temporary decreased sexual desire and a decreased ability to have orgasms.  These side effects went away after about 6 months on this drug. I take one 20 mg. pill once a day at the same time.  I usually take my pill first thing in the morning because it's easier for me to remember.  I did research on this product before I actually started taking it and found that the 20 mg. dose had the same results as the 40 mg. dose and showed no marked improvement.  The 20 mg. dose has been great for me.,high
retin-a,9,"retin-a acne - Smoother skin with no pimples present. Lessening of fine lines. More even and radiant skin tone Slight peeling and redness when treatment began I began taking Retin-A because my skin was having breakouts at a very frequent rate. I began by washing my face with a mild ceanser. I alternated between Dove senstive skin and Cetaphil. The face must be washed gently with NO manipulation, scrubbing or washcloth!! After this I rinse with warm water to make sure all soap residue is gone. I then LIGHTLY pat my face dry with the softest towel I can find. Let the face AIR DRY for 15 minutes, then a PEA size amount of Retin-A can be applied to the face. This little amount is for the WHOLE face. Once the whole face is covered with the Retin-A , let it sink in for 5 minutes, then apply a moisturizer. I like to use Cetaphil cream for this or Moisturel. Remember that Retin-A should ONLY be used at NIGHT!! You must wear an SPF 30 sunscreen during the day as it makes the skin sensitive.",high
clomid,8,"clomid infertility - Increased my estrogen levels, started ovulating again, and after about 6 months my ovulation formed a predictable pattern with an ending menstrual period. It was an easy small sized capsule to swallow and did not break down in water. Once ovulation was kicked off and preganancy still did not occur, it allowed my obstetrician to focus on other possible problems. Initially there were no problems, but after a week or so, began to suffer from blurred vision, which would appear and disappear at random. Hot flushes would also be sporadic. I also had a sense of ""scatterbrain"" ie my mind felt jumbled up, I could not make quick decisions, everything seemed blurry in my head. My stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  On some days I vomitted.Over time this decreased, and eventually after 1 and 1/2 years these symptons stopped. The time line probably could be reduced, but on ocassions of sickness, I stopped taking clomid and began the next month. My skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. I had a very heightened sense of smell as well. After a first successful pregnancy, my attempts at a second were not succeeding. Medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. This coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. A dosage of Clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels, produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. Clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness, vomitting, unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity, which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. Over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones, the side effects stopped. Whilst not inducing a pregancy, it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. Overall, Clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. I would recommend its use.",high

By day 5 I was hospitalized in intensive care.",Low
neurontin,8,"neurontin epilepsy, depression and pain - This medication was initially prescribed for pain management and was somewhat effective, but a new neurologist suggested incresing the dose as an addition to the anti-seizure medications that were not completely controlling my epilesy.  This addition finally got the seizures completely under control. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseated if I take it with my other medications. As I stated, increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.  I was originally prescribed this drug for pain management of a chronic pain problem, but in a lower dose. While I feel that is has only had a minimal effect of lmy pain, the higher dose has gotten my seizures under control.  I also suffer from depression and a panic disorder that may be helped from this drug, but I think that that may be true indirectly, as I think the elimination of the seizures has been the main cause of the relief, particularly the anxiety.",high
